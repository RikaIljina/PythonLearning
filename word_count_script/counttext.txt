Abstract 
.The Myth of the Woman Warrior and World War II in Soviet Culture. 
defines, analyzes, and explains the figure of the Soviet .woman warrior. who 
participated in World War II, asking the questions: what is the nature of the woman 
warrior in works about World War II and what does her portrayal tell us about Soviet 
culture and memory? Although the woman warrior has deep roots in Russian 
culture, this topic has received almost no attention from a cultural perspective. After 
a discussion of the 1930s militarization, this study turns to works depicting women 
who participated in WWII and argues that these depictions fall into three types based 
on deep archetypes: the martyr, handmaiden, and the .polianitsa,. or knight. This 
dissertation elucidates essentialist and constructivist intersections by investigating 
why certain images of women motivated Soviet citizens during the war and then 
became powerful myths that shaped national consciousness.

(And [Zina Radina] will never forget at what cost we came into possession of 
our bright life, will never forget her beautiful military youth. I saw how she 
told her son about the war. Seriously and warily, as though listening to the 
distant thunder of battle. Surely, that is how all of us former frontline 
soldiers remember our youth, the youth that passed in the fir. of the Great 
Patriotic War.) 
With this excerpt, we glimpse a woman veteran‘s effort to convey her experience as 
a fighter pilot in World War II to a younger person. Hero of the Soviet Union 
Marina Chechneva captures Zina Radina‘s pride in her military service. Years after 
the war, Radina still hears the thunder of battle and she describes the youth she spent 
at war as .splendid.. This dissertation examines the figure of the Soviet woman 
warrior of World War II, as represented by writers, artists, filmmakers, and the 
women veterans themselves as makers of cultural memory. Its goal is to imprint 
upon the reader how thoroughly these myths have penetrated Soviet culture. 
.The Myth of the Woman Warrior and World War II in Soviet Culture. 
addresses one of the less appreciated aspects of Russian culture as a whole: the 
perception of women at war. Most Russians who acknowledge women‘s 
participation in the war assume that, like much else, women who fought were simply 
following state policy and were motivated by a sense of patriotic duty. This

dissertation shows that there was a considerable dialogue between the state and its 
citizens across many cultural forms about women‘s motivations to fight. It examines 
the place of the archetype of the fighting woman in the war and Soviet culture in 
general. This study asks broad questions about the construction of gender, women‘s 
agency, and the fight over a nation‘s cultural memory. It investigates how women 
who fought in World War II are represented in texts, official and unofficial, public 
and private. 
This dissertation employs the term .woman warrior. popularized in the title 
of Maxine Hong Kingston‘s 1976 novel. In many cultures, the woman warrior is a 
deep-seated cultural pattern or archetype. She is a strong, courageous leader. Unlike 
the word .Amazon,. the woman warrior does not exist in a historical moment or a 
physical location. Her presence across cultures and through the centuries shows that 
she is one of the basic patterns in the human psyche. In Soviet culture, a woman 
warrior manifests herself as a soldier who participates in a combat situation either as 
a uniformed member of the armed services on the front or a woman waging war in 
the underground as a partisan. 
The mother remains by far the dominant female archetype in Russian culture. 
In contrast to Western cultures, where until recently women have debated taking up 
arms rather than actually doing it, the Russians have a long tradition of women going 
onto the battlefield and fighting alongside male soldiers. The acceptance of women 
in combat has waxed and waned throughout the ages, but during the militarization 
campaigns of the 1930s, the media bombarded women and girls with images that 

8 
encouraged them to prepare for an impeding war by learning how to handle 
weaponry, fly planes, nurse wounded, and conduct chemical warfare. These 
militarized women were hailed as .patriotic daughters of the Motherland. in popular 
magazines, and upon the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union June 22, 1941 many of 
them became snipers, pilots, doctors, nurses, medics, radio operators, and translators. 
Shortly after the beginning of the war, keepers of cultural memory— 
journalists, poets, fiction-writers—began writing about women soldiers. Some 
developed into vastly popular myths that shaped national consciousness and, indeed, 
continue to be recognized and embraced even after the end of the Soviet Union. 
Other female soldiers were forgotten shortly after the war. Why should this 
heroization of some and forgetting of others be the case? 
In this period, images of women warriors fall into three types based on deep 
cultural archetypes: the martyr, the handmaiden, and the knight (polianitsa). The 
Soviet woman warrior, of course, existed in the mass culture of a totalitarian regime 
and her image was strongly shaped by those in power. During the Stalinist period, in 
particular, there was little space for alternate voices. Against expectations, however, 
this dissertation finds that the portrayal of women warriors depends very much upon 
who is speaking, photographing, or painting and when he or she created the work. 
Why did women wage war on such a grand scale during the Soviet period, 
and what does the figure of the woman in combat mean in Soviet culture? Although 
there is little discourse related to women in combat, Soviet women inherited a deep 
tradition of women fighting on the battlefield. In July 1926, Commissar for Military 

9 
Affairs Kliment Voroshilov and Chief of Staff Mikhail Tukhachevskii determined in 
July, 1926 that the Red Army was unprepared for war.2 In response, the Soviet 
Union began the militarization campaign that led to the arming of hundreds of 
thousands of women. Prior militarization, Russian women had already long proven 
that they were suited for combat. This history, combined with propaganda and a 
state policy of preparing all citizens for war, set the stage for the mass entry of 
women into the military. This dissertation studies the manipulation of words and 
images used to inspire women to prepare for war and then the arguments made 
afterward about the meaning of women at arms. 
Cultural representations of East Slavic women fighting date back to pre- 
Christian time. In the magic tale .Mar‘ia Morevna,. Prince Ivan encounters a field 
of warriors, reportedly slain by a warrior queen: ......... . ......, ...-... .

troops lying slain on the field. Prince Ivan said: =If any man is alive here, let him 
answer me. Who slew this great army?‘ One man answered him: =All this great 
army was slain by Maria Morevna, the beautiful queen‘.).4 Women warriors also

play prominent roles in the heroic, epic, poems of the medieval period, byliny. In 
byliny, armed women, polianitsy, disguised as male knights, ride out onto the 
battlefield and challenge male warriors. 
In the bylina .Stavr Godinovich,. Vasilisa Nikulichna, Stavr‘s wife rescues 
her husband from Prince Vladimir‘s prison by assuming a male identity and proving 
to Vladimir (though archery, wrestling, and gusli playing) that she is a better warrior 
than any of Vladimir‘s retinue:

She took along a brave druzhina, 
Forty youths who were daring archers, 
Forty youths who were also daring wrestlers, 
She set off riding to the city of Kiev).6 
Polianitsy (female knights), like Vasilisa Nikulichna, are agents of their own fate. 
They do not think about the right to bear arms. They simply dress as male knights, 
and, as such, join the male establishment. 
These women are often motivated by a love for their homeland and a need to 
defend their father.7 They ride and fight as well as, if not better than, male knights

and are usually indistinguishable from them, until a key moment when the male 
knight bears his adversary‘s breast. In a striking parallel with the demobilized 
World War II veterans, these women are eventually compelled to stop waging war 
after marrying, Stavr Godinovich‘s wife being an exception. Even in the epic past, 
maternity and the military were considered to be incompatible. 
One also finds historical examples of women warriors, such as those that 
participated in Stepan Razin‘s uprising. One of them, Alena Arzamasskaia 
(Temnikovskaia) passed herself off as a Cossack leader and formed a detachment of 
men, which eventually grew to six thousand. After being captured and tortured, she 
was executed for refusing to name rebel leaders.8 Although Catherine the Great‘s 
close advisor Grigorii Potemkin formed a women‘s military company for the 
empress‘s amusement, they had no permanent place in Russian cultural memory.9 
Nadezhda Durova (1783-1866), the first Russian woman to serve as an officer in 
battle, was the first woman warrior to achieve national, lasting fame for her military 
exploits, after she published fictionalized memoirs about her experiences in the 
Napoleonic wars. Andreas Schnole argues that during Durova‘s service in the 
military, she creates an alternate gender identity, combining characteristics that

of his boasting that she is a more skilled warrior than Vladimir‘s male subjects.

qualified her as female while playing a male role.10 Russian women reportedly 
served in the Crimean War (1853-56) and participated in World War I in mixedgender 
military units, after passing themselves off as men.11 Many women served in 
Iasha Bochkareva‘s famed .women‘s death battalion. without disguising their 
gender identity. In the Civil War, women fought on every front in all capacities, in 
both women‘s segregated detachments and alongside men in mixed units, most 
notably as partisans and political commissars.12 These mythical and historical 
precedents supported the Soviet state‘s official position on gender equality and its 
need for trained combatants, leading to the mass influx of women into civil defense 
organizations in the decade and a half that preceded World War II. The massive 
inclusion of women in military life could not have happened at any time in Russian 
history other than in the late 1920s and 1930s when the fear of war overlapped with 
the expansion of opportunities for women. 
My study of the myth of the woman warrior is part of a larger discussion, 
which has captivated writers and scholars in various disciplines, as the image of the 
woman warrior has gained international prominence. Much recent interest in the 
image of the woman warrior has followed the reconfiguration of the Chinese 
folkloric figure of Mulan in Kingston‘s novel, The Woman Warrior. Kingston 
reworks the Mulan myth, merging maternity and warfare, so that Mulan marries and

bears a child while still in warrior‘s armor. Literary scholars have explored women 
warriors in Greek folk songs, in late medieval Italian prose epics, in the Amadis 
cycle, in seventeenth-century French fiction, in eighteenth-century Anglo-American 
ballads, in Italian and English Renaissance epics, and in nineteenth-century Bengali 
fiction.13 In 1991, Jessica Amanda Salmonson published an international 
compilation of both historical and mythological women warriors.14 Books about the 
most famous woman warrior, Joan of Arc, continue to appear. One finds evidence of 
the appeal of the woman warrior in anthropologist Jeannine Davis-Kimball‘s 
Warrior Women: An Archaeologist.s Search for History.s Hidden Heroines (2002), 
more an autobiography than a scholarly text.15 She directs her book toward a general 
audience as she details her research on nomads of the steppe, Caucasus, and 
Mongolia and introduces these nomads to the reader through the image of the 
Amazon, who, according to archeological evidence, roamed the steppes centuries 
ago.

The presence of women warriors across cultural, linguistic, and genre 
boundaries shows the controversial character of the armed woman in culture. This 
dissertation contributes to the international scholarly discussion the first lengthy 
study of the woman warrior in Soviet culture. Originally, I had conceived of this 
study as an analysis of the archetype of the Russian woman warrior in nineteenthand 
twentieth-century literature, but after discovering the multitude of works in 
various genres related to women soldiers in World War II, I decided to focus the 
dissertation on that period. Since official propaganda in the 1930s and World War II 
exploited this deep tradition, women volunteers were aware of their forebears. 
This dissertation relies on theoretical tools from disparate disciplines: literary 
studies, cultural studies, gender studies, history, anthropology, and folklore. The 
centuries-long phenomenon of women appearing as warriors led me first to approach 
primary texts from the point of view of Jungian psychological-archetypal criticism, 
as formulated by Jung, analyzing the woman warrior as an archetype. Carl Jung‘s 
definition of archetypes as instincts or physiological urges that manifest themselves 
in fantasies as symbolic images was particularly helpful, especially if one considers 
works of art or literature to be fantastic in nature, regardless of their grounding in socalled 
truth.16 
Several literary critics have employed Jungian archetypal theory in the study 
of literary works. Annis Pratt applies archetypal approaches to New Feminist 
Criticism to explore the relationship between archetypal and feminist theories while

classifying and analyzing novels written by women.17 Estella Lauter and Carol 
Schreier Rupprecht define terms and outline the relationship of archetypal and 
feminist theories in order to recast Jungian concepts to reflect women‘s 
experiences.18 Lauter deals with the Amazon type and asks how to apply an 
archetypal approach to a work of art. Since, she argues, one must regard each work 
of art as part of a larger pattern, one must analyze other manifestations of the images, 
in addition to the artist‘s work, life, and society.19 An archetypal approach has 
helped me conceptualize typologies of the three kinds of woman warrior and has 
made me aware of similarities in the most diverse of cultural texts. 
Although several scholars, among them Adele Marie Barker and Johanna 
Hubbs, have applied archetypal approaches to Russian culture, they have primarily 
focused on the archetype of the mother. Barker approaches byliny and some 
nineteenth-century literary works from a psychoanalytic perspective and analyzes 
feminine roles in byliny.20 Hubbs examines the prevalence of the Mother myth in 
Russian (and Soviet) culture—in folkloric agricultural representations (Moist Mother 
Earth) and in descriptions of the land (Russia).21 She traces the myth of maternity

and fertility through prehistoric artifacts, archaic myths, folktales, epics, and rituals 
of the East Slavs. 
While scholars have virtually ignored the archetype of the woman warrior, 
some work has been done on the figure of the so-called .strong woman.. Joan 
Delaney Grossman examines portrayals of women in Russian literature and art from 
the tenth through the early seventeenth centuries, including the folkloric genres of 
byliny, skazki, bridal songs, and concludes that Russians view the strong woman as 
dangerous.22 
Beyond archetypal theory, gender and sexual criticism provide tools for 
understanding a culture. Simone de Beauvoir was among the first philosophers to 
argue that gender is a cultural construction. She also argues that some women 
achieve independence and liberation through taking action.23 Her approach to 
gender as a construction helped me understand the Soviet redefinition of gender roles 
in the 1930s as well as the gender disputes in texts by and about women warriors. 
Furthermore, in my examination of the warrior-martyr, I found help in de Beauvoir‘s 
psychology of martyrdom, focusing on the satisfaction martyrs experience in 
mutilation of their flesh when dedicated to a higher ideal or belief system.24 
In Terrible Perfection (1987), perhaps the most influential feminist treatment 
of Russian literature, Barbara Heldt applies an .American. feminist approach. She 
explores the observations that most memorable heroines in Russian literature appear

Studies, 11 (1980): 33-70.

17 
in socially conservative works penned by men and that most feminist novels also 
were written by men. She argues that the seemingly established canon of Russian 
classics is actually a .densely woven web of conventional expectations..25 Despite 
expectations in this canon, one finds a strong heroine who contrasts with the weak 
masculine type of the .superfluous man.. Heldt further shows that works written by 
women provide alternate voices to those found in male-authored works. She finds 
that Russian women typically express themselves in genres in which the feminine 
has not already been defined by men, in autobiographical and lyrical genres, rather 
than novels. 26 Although Heldt limits her study to the nineteenth century, she 
provides a framework for considering women in Russian literature. She examines 
the differences between women‘s and men‘s voices, as I will in this study. I find that 
the body of works about World War II produced by women warriors reinforces 
Heldt‘s pattern as most women represented themselves in memoirs and lyric poetry. 
Russians themselves have written almost nothing about women at war, 
neither women contemplating a role in combat, nor critics writing about the topic. 
In contrast, women in the West have long written about combat, associating the right 
to bear arms with power. In contrast to Russian women, although they have fought 
much less often in war, English and French women have been writing about gender 
and combat for roughly three hundred years. Early women‘s rights advocate Mary 
Astell argues in .The Worth and Excellency of the Superior Sex. (1700) that men‘s

University Press, 1987), 4.

18 
exclusivity of warfare gives evidence only of their dominance, rather than their 
superiority. In .Sophia, a Person of Quality. (1739), Lady Mary Wortley Montague 
writes that there are no physical, emotional, moral, or intellectual reasons to exclude 
women from war; she maintains, rather, that women‘s exclusion from the military 
can be attributed to their abhorrence of slaughter and value of peace. Mary 
Wollstonecraft, in her .A Vindication of the Rights of Woman. (1792), opposed 
women bearing arms, but advocated that men‘s military service and women‘s 
maternity should be equally valued in society. In 1791, Pauline Leon, the future 
leader of the French Society of Revolutionary Republican Women, submitted a 
petition carrying three hundred signatures demanding the right to form a women‘s 
militia on the basis that a woman, like a man, has the right to defend herself and the 
Revolution. During World War I, some suffragettes argued for the right to fight on 
the battlefield, while others opposed the war entirely. Virginia Woolf eventually 
advocated for women‘s inclusion in combat as a way to undermine men‘s power 
(1966). In 1982, Mary Wechsler Segal posited that the military would lose its 
function as an arena in which a man could prove masculinity if young women were 
included.27 
Although the vast majority of Soviet women who participated in World War 
II could not have been aware of Western discourse related to women in combat, this 
tradition is not irrelevant, as this dissertation is informed by Western cultural values.

Women in the West have defined themselves as potential warriors, in contrast to 
Russia, in which one does not find much evidence of women thinking of themselves 
as such. Even in medieval folk accounts, although women would not engage in any 
discussion about war, they would fight heroically on the battlefield, as illustrated in 
the example of Vasilisa Nikulichna. 
Although historical and literary/folklore examples of women warriors 
abound, one knows nearly nothing about Russian women‘s thoughts about warfare 
before the publication of Nadezhda Durova‘s The Cavalry Maiden (..........- 
......, 1836), a fictionalized account of a noble-woman‘s adventures as an officer 
in the Russian cavalry. Durova writes only about her own experience, attributing her 
flight from home and assumption of a male identity to a personal need for freedom 
and a rejection of strict gender roles, writing nothing about a woman‘s right to wage 
war. 
The next women to engage in armed combat did so for ideological purposes. 
During the second half of the 19th century, some women radicals took up weapons, 
but rather than self-liberation and freedom, these women were motivated by the goal 
of liberating the peasants. Vera Zasulich, who attempted to assassinate the governor 
of St. Petersburg, became the first woman to use arms in the struggle for liberation. 
Early in her life, she envisioned herself as a type of Joan of Arc, leading a partisan 
horse brigade to liberate the peasants, but later disapproved of personal violence and 

20 
terrorist tactics.28 Radicals were most concerned with the issues of using violence in 
the fight for revolution, rather than a woman‘s right to engage in combat. 
In spite of this lack of discourse, one finds grass roots action in World War I 
and the Civil War, followed by the propaganda campaign that led to participation in 
World War II. This 1930s state-controlled discourse reconciled in the Soviet Union 
the incompatibility between motherhood and the military, so commonly discussed in 
the West. 
In light of the controversial nature of the contemporary debate about armed 
women in combat, social anthropologists, like Sharon MacDonald, edited of a 
volume of articles on the topic. Contributors to MacDonald‘s book analyze the 
construction of images women in war and the broader question of their place in 
society. They use sexual imagery to explore women‘s relationship to warfare, a 
traditionally male sphere and conclude that even when women and men are 
supposedly equal, gender remains an issue, often demonstrated on a symbolic level, 
rather than explicitly.29 
In recent years, scholars have increasingly applied a semiotic approach to 
culture, reading the body as text. In Sexuality and the Body (1993) Jane Costlow, 
Stephanie Sandler, and Judith Vowles explore Russian ideas about the body in 
relation to their ideas about sexuality. The editors note the conspicuous absence of 
Russian discourse related to sexuality and the body, in comparison to the tradition to

the West. This discursive paucity extends to the topic of this dissertation, a woman‘s 
right, desire, and suitability to wage war. Contributors question the uses of the 
woman‘s body in Russian culture, focusing on maternal and erotic female bodies. 
Although this dissertation examines the woman‘s body as an erotic object of the 
male gaze, it also treats muscular, androgynous bodies and mutilated, martyred 
bodies, which both represent strength, albeit in very different ways. 
Sexuality and the Body set the stage for several cultural histories of the 1920s 
and 1930s. Eric Naiman, Lilya Kaganovsky, and Pat Simpson all study the 
construction of gender, in the media, literature and in film, to understand the Stalinist 
period. They pay special attention to complicated and often contradictory 
representations of the body in various .texts.. Naiman analyzes public discourse as 
represented in NEP-era works, found in urban areas, tracing the treatment of men‘s 
and women‘s bodies and attitudes toward sexuality in state policy.30 He uses a 
culture-studies approach to analyze a variety of texts–speeches, court documents, 
literary works, and articles in the media. In his view, although the years immediately 
preceding the Revolution saw the creation of a .collective body. in cultural 
documents, attention to physical differences returned in the late NEP period, as the 
.collective body. began to fragment.31 He discusses the skinny, androgynous 
woman‘s body glorified during the NEP period, before turning to the reemergence of 
.Gothic. writing and its emphasis on morbid images in the late-NEP period. He

aims to elucidate .the narrative of early Soviet ideology,. and thus provides insight 
into the period in which the militarization movement stems. 
Simpson explores the woman‘s body as a locus of Soviet .political 
physiology. in her study of the fizkul.tura movement.32 She juxtaposes two images 
that appeared in the July, 1944, number of the journal, Red Sports (....... .....) 
and reconciles the simultaneous presence of two very different women‘s bodies in 
Soviet media: the teenager‘s muscular, androgynous body and the more voluptuous, 
woman‘s body. She concludes that this complexity represented both a hope in the 
New Soviet Person and the greater emphasis on the maternal that followed the 
turning point of World War II. She reads the body of the fizkul.turist as a metaphor 
for everything the state considered to be good, triumphant, victorious, strong, 
healthy, and beautiful. These bodies called for readers to participate in and affirm 
the collective identity. Beyond contributing to an understanding of the woman‘s 
body, her work offers a method for reading media images as texts. The Fizkul.tura 
movement is part of the larger militarization movement of the late 1920s-early war 
period, an epoch in which the Soviet state reevaluated and redefined desired physical 
characteristics, as visual representations of a underlying political ideology. My 
research on images in the media relates complements Simpson‘s work as the 
Fizkul.tura and the militarization movements are part of the same redefinition of 
beauty and gender. My dissertation continues Simpson‘s reading media images as

texts to understand Soviet messages about the body and by, extension, gender roles, 
but it also analyses the public‘s spontaneous reactions to these various bodies. 
Thomas G. Schrand discusses the shift in gender divisions and the 
masculinization of the Soviet Union in the 1930s.33 He explores the meaning of the 
disassembly of the Department of Women‘s Affairs (Zhenotdel) and relates its 
dissolution to Eric Naiman‘s findings on the erasure of the .feminine. that marks the 
late 1920s. Schrand posits that the .wartime. culture of the 1930s narrowed the gap 
between male and female and privileged masculinity, as the country prepared itself 
for war. 
Anna Krylova studies the 1930s militarization, asking how a generation of 
women came to wage war.34 She rejects the commonly held notion that the 1930s 
was a conservative reversal of 1920s gender roles and uses the term .alternative 
gender personality. to describe the construction of a gender that embodies qualities 
both traditionally and nontraditionally feminine. She argues that the right to wage 
war marked a major challenge to surviving traditional ideas of femininity and 
masculinity, although this broadening of gender roles proved to be short-lived. 
Kaganovsky has contributed much to the recent scholarship on the male 
body. In her article .How the Soviet Man was (Un) Made,. Kaganovsky explores, 
using the example of Nikolai Ostrovskii, the sacrifice expected of the New Soviet 
33 Thomas G. Schrand, .Socialism in One Gender: Masculine Values in the Stalin Revolution,. in

Man, whose dedication to the Soviet cause eclipses his physical existence and basic 
human needs.35 Throughout his suffering, Ostrovskii dreams of achieving Soviet 
subjectivity. Kaganovsky also defines 1930s notions of Soviet masculinity, 
concluding that masculinity is a state-sanctioned construction. The state can 
transform both wild children and female collective farm workers into Soviet men, 
manipulating them into subordinate subjects while purging those who do not 
conform to the collective.36 This 1930s demand of physical sacrifice is realized on a 
national scale in World War II. It sets the stage for Zoia Kosmodemian‘skaia‘s 
martyrdom, which will form an important part of my dissertation. 
In this study, I treat a variety of materials as cultural texts: articles and 
images in the media, propaganda posters, novels, films, novellas, narrative and lyric 
poems, memoirs, biographies, paintings, sculptures, and songs. This analysis of 
them relies heavily on the .cultural studies. approach, pioneered in the Russian area 
by Richard Stites, which examines broad patterns of signification in a range of 
cultural texts. Stites studies entertainment and its consumers, mass culture and its 
erosion after Stalin‘s death, and argues for the value of studying cultural documents 
that fall beyond the realm of high culture. Likewise, Catriona Kelly and David 
Shepherd defend cultural studies for opening the way for the study of previously 
undervalued cultural documents and identities. Emphasizing the relationship

between the political and the cultural, cultural studies define the political as part of 
culture.37 Cultural studies adopt a .broad, inclusive approach,. rather than 
privileging high culture, unique and original, over mass culture, which is often 
repetitive and ritualistic. Kelly and Shepherd undertake to study various cultural 
documents in order to isolate aspects of Russian culture that are rarely considered 
together. They analyze cultural production and consumption and the construction of 
both individual and national identities. 
Mark D. Steinberg examines the link between early Soviet literature and 
Christianity by exploring religious imagery in workers‘ writing in the years prior to 
and after the 1917 revolution. He demonstrates the importance in early Soviet 
literature of the religious symbolism that later dominates works about women 
warrior-martyrs.38 Nina Tumarkin‘s The Living and the Dead (1994) provides a 
helpful example of how to approach a variety of texts to understand Soviet 
mythologization of World War II. She has started the discussion of the warriormartyr, 
Zoia Kosmodem‘ianskaia as a Soviet saint. 
Beyond archetypal, cultural, and gender studies, this dissertation is indebted 
to Katerina Clark‘s structuralist/historical approach to Soviet literature in The Soviet 
Novel: History as Ritual.39 Arguing that socialist realist literature is formulaic and 
employing Vladimir Propp‘s formalist study of the magic tale as a model, Katerina

Clark outlines a morphology of the Soviet novel. She traces precedents of the Soviet 
novel, defines key terms, and identifies characteristic features. In addition to 
formulating a master plot of the Soviet novel, she supercedes traditional structuralist 
methodology in order to detail a .dynamic account. of the novel‘s evolution within 
the Soviet context.40 She discusses the novel‘s relationship to ideological, political, 
and social factors. Clearly, Clark‘s technique of combining anthropological and 
historical approaches with structuralism and her study of the martyr as hero are 
particularly helpful to a dissertation that aims not only to distill a masterplot of the 
woman warrior-martyr narrative, but also to understand the role the state played in 
shaping its creation. 
In crafting my approach to the archetype of the woman warrior and her 
myths, I have had to learn how to interpret visual, as well as, verbal images. Of help 
in this endeavor has been the concept of .iconography. used in Elizabeth Waters‘s 
.The Female Form in Soviet Political Iconography, 1917-32..41 Waters discusses 
women in Soviet .iconography,. represented in stamps, coins, propaganda posters, 
and other visual texts. This dissertation aims to analyze official visual images of the 
woman warrior martyrs so as to understand the state‘s shaping of their myths. 
Victoria E. Bonnell studies Soviet political posters through Stalin‘s death 
with the aim of understanding how the state created a .Homo Sovieticus,. or Soviet 
man.42 She examines the images, considering historical and mythological context,

treating the images as part of visual language and studies their reception, attempting 
to determine their effectiveness as propaganda tools. Bonnell argues that the purpose 
of political art was to .provide a visual script. to conjure up new modes of thinking 
and conduct.43 Lynne Atwood studies women in film, another visual propaganda 
tool.44 As part of her history of Soviet cinema, she discusses both the employment of 
film as a medium for creating visual symbols and rituals and the historical role of 
Soviet women in cinema. 
The first chapter, .=. . .... ..... ........‘: Soviet Women and the 
Militarization of the 1930s,. analyzes various texts (novels, films, articles, and 
images in the media) throughout the late 1920s and the 1930s to determine what 
cultural prompts appealed to such a wide array of women, transforming them into 
soldiers. I examine the propaganda messages in the media, building on the 
mythology of the Soviet .great family.. 
In the three following chapters, I build typologies of the three kinds of 
woman warriors and summarize the master plot for each, paying close attention to 
the semiotics of the female body in the context of Stalinist and post-Stalinist cultural 
codes. I examine crucial verbal and visual texts and finish by summarizing the place 
each type of woman warrior currently occupies in cultural memory. Chapter Two, 
.=......., ... ..........:‘ The Woman Warrior-Martyr,. treats the role of this 
martyr-heroine in Soviet mass culture. The discussion focuses largely on legendary

to the End of the Communist Era (London: Pandora Press, 1993).

figure Zoia Kosmodem‘ianskaia. The chapter addresses the reasons that the warriormartyr 
gained the status as the heroine of a national myth in Stalinist culture. 
Chapter Three, .The Gendered Gaze: Disarming the Woman Warrior,. 
examines the image of the woman warrior as represented in male-authored texts: 
novels, novellas, short stories, and films. I approach these male writers‘ works as a 
form of resistance to the militarization of women and as part of a postwar policy of 
returning women to their traditional roles as mother and wife. Against all 
expectation, I discovered at least one major Soviet woman poet, Iuliia Drunina, who 
rejects this .refemininzation.. 
Chapter Four, ........ ........: Women Warriors and Their Epic 
Battle for Soviet Cultural Memory,. explores women warriors‘ heroic selfrepresentations, 
also part of women‘s efforts to secure a place for themselves in 
Russian cultural memory. This chapter relies heavily on memoirs and biographies 
written by women veterans. 
By analyzing the Soviet images of woman warriors this dissertation 
contributes to the international discussion of the archetype of what. In terms of 
Russian studies, it elucidates the shaping of national myths and the preservation of 
cultural memory, as well as the responses of the general public, writers and artists, 
and women who themselves waged war to the portrayal of Soviet women soldiers. It 
adds to the growing discourse on the body in Russian culture ad contributes to the 
understanding of gender roles and expectations throughout the Soviet period.

Iu. Chudov‘s propaganda poster .We Will Be Pilots, .... (.. .. ..... 
.........,. 1951) featuring two young boys holding a model airplane and looking 
to the sky, remains one of the most recognizable propaganda posters depicting young 
people dreaming about flying.45 This poster, published in the postwar period, 
directly targets boys through the two obviously male subjects of the poster and the 
word choice letchikami, specifically =male pilots.‘46 It contrasts dramatically with 
posters and magazine covers targeting youth in the prewar period, when women and 
girls were included in militarization campaigns and encouraged to look to the skies. 
This inclusiveness is apparent in G. Klutsis‘s poster, .Young people, to your 
planes!. (........., .. ........,. 1934) and P. Karachentsov‘s .Every 
Collective Farm, Every Factory. (....... ......, ...... .....,. 1936).47

warfare and were eager to defend their homeland against the invaders. Throughout 
the 1930s the media had prepared Soviet citizens to expect war and the generation of 
women that had come of age in the 1930s participated in the militarization of the 
country. This chapter examines the images in mass culture and the media that 
conveyed the expectation that women could become warriors—pilots, parachutists, 
or sharp-shooters—and that there was room in Soviet life for such dreams. 
In Wings, Women, and War: Soviet Airwomen in World War II Combat, 
Reina Pennington argues that the existence of a folkloric tradition of fighting women 
contributed to women‘s participation in front-line combat. In her view, although 
women were rarely encouraged to fight prior to the 1930s, there were historical 
precedents that made it easier for Soviet women to fight than for their sisters in other 
countries. Pennington writes, the folkloric heritage, .combined with a general 
belief that Russian women were physically strong, made it thinkable for women en 
masse to engage in combat in the Second World War..48 
Although Russian women had not been encouraged to fight in previous wars, 
the Soviet press testifies, as Anna Krylova argues, that the Party encouraged and 
public opinion embraced the image of the militarized woman in the years leading up 
to World War II.49 This chapter will examine how the women who fought in the war

University of Kansas Press, 2001), 4. 
49 There were women‘s units in World War I and women had served as nurses in the Russo-Japanese 
war, but during these wars, the media did not encourage women to take up weapons. Much of the 
argument and material in this chapter corroborates Anna Krylova‘s excellent article, .Stalinist Identity 
from the Viewpoint of Gender: Rearing a Generation of Professionally Violent Women-Fighters in 
1930s Stalinist Russia. Gender and History 16, no. 3 (November, 2004): 626-653. In her article, 
Krylova analyzes memoirs, diaries, and the newspaper Komsomolskaia Pravda and concludes that by 

31 
became hardened .warriors. and will further develop Anna Krylova‘s argument by 
examining the hundreds of images of fighting women in popular magazines, such as 
Osoaviakhim/ Voroshilovskii strelok (Osoaviakhim/ Voroshilov.s Shot), Samolet 
(Airplane), and the most widely read women‘s magazine, Rabotnitsa (Woman 
Worker). In addition, this chapter analyzes official rhetoric, crafted both to 
encourage women to participate in paramilitary activities and force the public to 
rethink a woman‘s role and responsibility in warfare. 
Militarization of women was the result of the Soviet Union‘s mass 
mobilization of all citizens, beginning in July 1926, after Commissar for Military 
Affairs Kliment Voroshilov and Chief of Staff Mikhail Tukhachevskii began 
pressing for a stronger, better funded Soviet army, one prepared for war.50 In 1927, 
in an open letter to readers .Women Workers, Prepare the Country for Defense!.

eyes of danger, to be ready for rebuff, that is the primary duty of the workers and

late 1920s and 1930s, Komsomol leaders presented the coming war as the younger 
generation‘s .test,. the equivalent of their parents‘ Civil War and encouraged 
women to look to women who fought in the Civil War as examples:

(In the difficult years of the Civil War the woman worker was both a warrior 
with a rifle and a worker at the machine. And in the coming war, she will be 
not only a warrior, not only an organizer of urban defense, but she will have 
to replace workers who go off to war.)53 
The Komsomol received support in preparation efforts by the government-supported 
civil defense organization Osoaviakhim, the Society for Promotion of Defense, 
Aviation, and Chemical Development, formed in 1927. Osoaviakhim provided

instruction in shooting, parachuting, and aviation.54 By July 1929, it claimed 
700,000 women as its members, having acquired 100,000 new women members 
since March of the same year.55 In 1931, it claimed 11 million members overall. By 
the late 1930s, 1.7 million young people had earned Rifleman badges under the 
direction of Osoaviakhim.56 
Buttressing the efforts of the Komsomol and Osoaviakhim, mass culture of 
the late 1920s and 1930s produced a number of images of armed women: Anna, the 
first major woman warrior character in a widely read novel, Mikhail Sholokhov‘s 
And Quiet Flows the Don (..... ..., 1928), Anka in Georgii and Sergei Vasil‘ev‘s 
film Chapaev (1934), Zhenia Garasenkova from Petr Pavelnko‘s novel In the East 
(Na vostoke,1936), and Agrippina Chebrets in Aleksei Tolstoi‘s Bread 
(Khleb,1937).57 Sholokhov‘s Anna, a machine-gunner in the Civil War, possesses 
many of the traits of the 1930s armed woman. She is confident, able, aggressive, and 
dedicated to the cause. She initially encounters old-fashioned attitudes toward 
women soldiers such as Bunchuk‘s exclamation upon learning that Anna would be 
joining his detachment: .... ... ...—. ... .......: ....... ........ . ....,

this isn‘t fit work for you; the work is heavy and needs a man‘s strength. What kind 
of nonsense is this?.)59 Through her perseverance, Anna overcomes these attitudes 
and changes the minds of her comrades. Anna is the first in a series of women 
warriors to show unusual loyalty to her weapon, transferring her affection from a 
man to a machine gun:

(Anna Pogudko inquired about everything with keen curiosity. She pestered 
Banchuk, plucked at his sleeve, and could not be displaced from the machine 
gun. 
.And what would happen if the water were to freeze in the waterjacket?...
What deviation has to be allowed for in a strong wind?. She plied 
him with questions, expectantly raising her warmly gleaming black eyes to 
his).61 
In spite of this attention to her gun and the fact that Anna fights in battles and 
presumably shoots, the reader never sees her killing someone. During her first 
battle, she is overcome with fear after seeing death up close. 
Sholokhov prefigures the tendency of male authors in the decades to come by 
disarming Anna after she develops romantic feelings toward her commanding 
officer, Bunchuk. First, when Bunchuk falls ill with typhus, he transforms her into a 
nurse, when Bunchuk falls ill with typhus. Later, Anna is reassigned to agitation

35 
work, which she claims is better suited to her character. She is never merely a 
comrade, like Pavlenko‘s Zhenia eight years later. Rather she is also lover and 
mother, almost from her initial appearance in the novel. The narrator writes, 
....... ..... ...... .. .... .. ...... ..... ......., .. . .. ......, 
....... ....... . ......, ........... ............. (.Bunchuk long felt on 
himself not only the caress of his beloved, but also her warm, overflowing motherly 
care.). 62 Anna dies in the field during an attack on the enemy, partly because she 
makes a bad choice, charging before the rest of the detachment is ready to charge.63 
Sholokhov sends the message that women are able fighters, but their .feminine. 
nature makes them better suited to nurturing roles. Regardless of this conservative 
attitude toward women soldiers, the inclusion of Anna in a realist novel showed that 
women in combat were a reality both historically and in the cultural imagination. 
The novel raised many of the questions that occupied Party officials and the Soviet 
public in the 1930s: questions of women‘s right to fight, their abilities, and their 
integration into predominantly male military organizations. 
The 1934 film version about legendary Civil War commander Vasilii 
Chapaev differs markedly from the 1924 Furmanov novel, Chapaev, by creating the 
familiar female soldier character, Anka the Machine-Gunner. Unlike Sholokhov‘s 
Anna, Anka is a fighter, and her addition to the film serves as an important 
revolutionary precedent for the militarized women of the 1930s.64 She is enthusiastic

36 
and intelligent, eagerly and quickly learning how to use a machine gun. Anka is 
serious and angrily repels her male machine-gun instructor‘s advances. Krylova 
points out that the inclusion of Anka allowed artists to consider competition between 
the sexes. When male comrades-in-arms encourage her to shoot prematurely in a 
battle, Anka dismisses them, refusing to rush and shooting only at the right moment, 
successfully stopping the advancing line of White troops. She demonstrates calmness 
and skill her fellow soldiers lack.65 
The inclusion of Anka in this popular film shows that already in 1934, 
official policy advocated a woman gunner who could be trusted to handle one of the 
technically advanced machines of contemporary warfare, the machine gun, and that 
she could be integrated into a male regiment. A review in Rabotnitsa shows that the 
actress who played Anka, Varvara Miasnikova, intended the character to serve as an 
example for Soviet women: .. . .... ....... .... ...... ..........., .... 
....... ...... .... .. .......... ...... ..... .. ....., ..... ..... ..... 
... . .. ...... ..... ..........., —....... .... ........., —. . .... .... 
........ .. ........ ..-..........!. (.=And I would consider my task fulfilled, 
if the picture were to persuade even a few women to go to the front if there were to 
be a war. Not only do I play a machine-gunner,‘ says Comrade Miasnikova, =but I 
myself can actually shoot a machine gun!‘.).66 Shchelkanova mentions several 
actual women machine-gunners who had fought in the Civil War and notes that they 
sent letters to the Vasil‘ev brothers through Pravda, expressing their gratitude that

37 
the directors had included the image of a woman warrior.67 The article conveys the 
message that readers should look to Civil War women machine-gunners like Anka as 
role models. 
The year 1936 saw the appearance of another woman warrior: Zhenia 
Garasenkova in Petr Pavlenko‘s novel In the East (.. .......), a novel about a 
fictional war with Japan in the near future (in .193_.). Garasenkova skillfully 
handles arguably the most sophisticated machine, the airplane, while serving among 
men.68 Garasenkova, a female pilot and Komsomol member, actively participates in 
combat after Russia and Japan declare war, even enthusiastically bombing the 
enemy. Garasenkova is a fearless aviator. When we meet her, she is returning from 
the taiga, where she has undertaken dangerous, long-distance flights in adverse 
conditions.69 After encountering mechanical problems resulting from the loss of two 
engines, she successfully parachutes from her plane. 
Like the .female Komsomol patriots. (..........-...........) pictured 
in popular journals, Garasenkova flies for patriotic reasons. We know nothing of 
Garasenkova‘s education and profession before aviation. Like Raskova, she does not 
herself choose to become a pilot, but is chosen by an aviator, a party member, who 
wants to train her. Her entrance into aviation, not by her own personal desire, but at 
the prompting of an experienced pilot, suggests that women must be active in 
defense primarily because they are vital to the state. Upon completion of training,

love for the Motherland motivates Garasenkova to fly and eventually to fight. In a 
pivotal scene at the start of the war, Garasenkova is moved by the .Internationale. 
and proclaims: ........ ......, ....... ............, ... ......... .... .. 
....... ...., —........ ........ —... .. .... ....... ...... ....... 
...., ... ....... ....... . ......., ... ....... ......., ... ......... 
....... ....... . ....... (.=Thank you to the Party, thank you to the 
commanding officers, for sending me on this great mission,‘ —cried Evgeniia. =— 
I‘m going for all women of our union. I will fight, as our elders fought in October, 
as the Spanish fought, as Chinese women fought in Fushun.‘.70 While flying on her 
first combat mission, she enthusiastically exclaims to her airplane: .=......, 
.......! .........., ......!‘ ...... ...... ... . ....... ........ 
(.Forward, Airplane! Komsomol member, forward!. she sang cheerfully in nervous 
joy.). 71 
Pavlenko‘s portrayal of Garasenkova not only reflects the celebration of 
women in aviation and in traditionally male-dominated fields, but also resolves some 
of the questions party officials were asking about women's participation in civil 
defense: Should the new woman hero have a family? Should regiments be separated 
by gender? Krylova argues that Soviet military officials hesitated to put women in 
men‘s regiments, and at the time of the Nazi invasion, were still deciding where 
women belonged: in segregated women‘s regiments or in mixed regiments. 
Garasenkova flies as the only explicitly mentioned woman in an all-male regiment.

She encounters no discrimination or disrespect in Pavlenko‘s idealized world. 
Unlike many of the prominent women pilots in the late 1930s, Garasenkova is single 
and childless and, since she has decided to forego family life in favor of a military 
career, ....... .... ....... .... ......, ....... (.she led her fate alone 
farther, forward.), regardless of men‘s romantic interest in her, unlike Sholokhov‘s 
Anna, she does not become distracted.72 Pavlenko implies that as long as men and 
women put the state before their personal interests, as positive heroes in socialist 
realist novels do, they can work and live together. Garasenkova‘s character 
embodies key traits of the new militarized woman hero of the 1930s: skill, strength, 
intelligence, patriotism, love for aviation, independence, toughness, and dedication 
to the state. 
Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, popular magazines published short stories 
and poems featuring women warriors, such as the ......., ........, ........... 
...... (.tall, beautiful, frowning girl.) in .Agrippina Chebrets,. an excerpt from 
Aleksei Tolstoi‘s 1937 novella .....,. a riflewoman in the Civil War.73 As in 
Sholokhov‘s And Quiet Flows the Don, although the commander, Parkhomenko, 
initially resists the integration of a woman into the all-male detachment, he accepts 
Agrippina after she persistently and angrily demands a rifle: ...... ........, — 
........., ....... ......., ...... ....... ....... . ....... .. ....

said the young woman in a young, rather hoarse, voice as she raised to him her

40 
beautiful, angry eyes under dark brows.).74 Parkhomenko good-naturedly admits her 
to the ranks. Agrippina is not fighting out of an individual desire, because she 
believes she must fight, but to serve her country. Tolstoi describes her difficulty 
walking, carrying heavy equipment: .........., ... ....., ....... .......: 
... .. ........ ........ ..-......., ... ......, —... ....... 
.......…........ ... ...... (.Like a bird, Agrippina cocked her head: she 
decided not to shoot blindly, like the others, —wasting bullets in vain ... she knew 
how to shoot.).75 Although patient and calm, Agrippina fights aggressively in battle, 
engaging in one-on-one combat with a Cossack. Tolstoi portrays a tough warrior 
who introduces herself by saying .. ...... ...... (.I killed a Cossack.) and 
details her performance in battle.76 Like Anna, Agrippina sets herself apart from her 
male comrades, by not acting hastily. She is the antithesis of Sholokhov‘s Anna, 
who is naturally drawn to roles involving nurturing and spreading propaganda and is 
less aggressive than her male comrades. Agrippina loves to fight, and she differs 
from her comrades only in her heightened seriousness and calmness in battle. 
In addition to giving political guidance to writers, the policy decision to 
militarize women also gave thematic fodder to visual artists. In 1939, Voroshilovskii 
strelok reported that Leningrad artist N. M. Kochergin had finished a series of 
sketches on the theme, .The Armed Komsomol. (............ .........). The 
magazine reproduced one of these sketches, .Voroshilov‘s shots. (.............. 
74 Ibid., 16. 
75 Ibid., 17. 
76 Ibid., 16. 

41 
........) which features two women aiming pistols into the distance, while a male 
comrade lies on the ground, looking through binoculars. Like Bograd‘s Sanit poster, 
the women‘s depiction breathes youth, strength, and beauty.77 Kochergin‘s sketch of 
three young people also captures the camaraderie of the militarization movement 
(figure 1).78 
The years 1936-1938 proved to be pivotal in the militarization propaganda 
campaign. In August 1937, Komsomolskaia Pravda reported receiving letters from 
young women who hoped to pursue military careers and were determined to 
contribute to the defense of their country. This article officially opened a public 
debate about the women‘s role in the military.79 During these three years, women 
officers entered the public sphere as newspapers and magazines began to publicize 
their accomplishments.80 Women had been generally prohibited from serving in the 
military, but some women, Marina Nesternko, Tamara and Marina Kazarinova, Vera 
Lomako, Polina Osipenko, Marina Raskova, Klavdia Urazova, and Nina Rusakova, 
had all entered army service, in violation of official military rules. The male army 
officers who bent the rules and encouraged certain women to become officers paved 
the way for what would become the single most influential event in the militarization 
of Soviet women: the 1938 flight of the airplane Rodina.81

In September 1938, upon completion of a world-record-breaking, longdistance 
flight from Moscow to the Far East, pilots Polina Osipenko, Valentina 
Grizodubova, and Marina Raskova became the first women to be named Heroes of 
the Soviet Union.82 These three pilots were celebrated throughout the nation, and 
Stalin and Voroshilov themselves congratulated the women upon their return to 
Moscow.83 A junior political leader or .politruk,. Ia. Chapichev, celebrated their 
heroism and hailed them as .warriors and heroes. (...... . ......) in his poem, 
.Three Friends: To the Proud Falcons of Our Motherland, Grizodubova, Osipenko, 
Raskova. (.... .......: ...... ....... ..... ......, ............, 
........, .........)84 In his poem, Chapichev transforms the three women into 
legendary folk heroes: .Three pilots on a fairy tale bird. (.... ...... .. 
......... ......). At the height of their popularity, the influential Raskova and 
Osipenko published widely-read memoirs that inspired women across the nation. 
In contrast to the heroine in Pavlenko‘s novel, the women of the Rodina 
showed that being a pilot and hero was not incompatible with motherhood. 
Raskova‘s telephone conversation with her daughter, from the Far East to Moscow, 
was broadcast across Soviet airwaves. The 1940 radio play .Tania‘s Mom and Tania 
Raskova. (....... .... . .... .......),. intended for preschool children, 
commences with Raskova‘s daughter asking the whereabouts of her mother, as her 
82 Having flown from Moscow to the far east, the three women had broke a women‘s long-distance 
world record. They were publicly recognized and journalists called upon young people to look to 
these women as role models. Krylova, 646.

mother flies the Rodina across the Soviet Union. The narrator explains why Tania

... ......... ....... ..... ...... ...... . ....... .... ...... . .... . 
... ......... ........—...... . ..... ..... ... ..... ... ....... 
......... .. ...... .. ....... ....... . ..... ......, .... .. ........ 
...... ......... (.Why? Because these three women took it upon themselves to 
prove that Soviet female pilots could fly farther and faster than all women in the 
world and that Soviet airplanes are the strongest and best of all. They want to fly 
from Moscow to the Far East without landing. And they will fly, until they have 
fulfilled their promise.).85 The radio play teaches children about the Rodina‘s 
victory, while holding Tania‘s bravery and patience during her mother‘s absence as 
an example for all children. This play, written just one year before the beginning of 
World War II, gives evidence that an armed woman‘s military endeavors takeover 
her maternal role. 
As Krylova shows, memoirs and letters indicate that Soviet women‘s 
conceptions of themselves had changed. Through their writing, women claimed the 
right and accepted responsibility to participate in a future war. For these women, 
military service had ceased to be solely a male occupation, and was open to all 
Soviet citizens.86 Both Rabotnitsa and Osoaviakhim/Voroshilovskii strelok published 
numerous personal accounts such as A Vavilova‘s narrative in .It is Not Only a

The Role of Popular Magazines 
Militarized woman appeared prominently in such daily newspapers as 
Komsomolskaia Pravda.88 Militarized women also appeared in magazines that 
targeted the general public, such as the women‘s magazines, Rabotnitsa and The 
Women.s Journal (Zhenskii zhurnal), and more specialized magazines that addressed 
hobbyists, Samolet and Osoaviakhim, and on occasion, At the Wheel (Za rulem). 
Throughout the history of the Soviet Union, Rabotnitsa, perhaps the most 
prominent women‘s journal, addressed women‘s concerns, both public and private, 
and represented the official party position toward Soviet women.89 From its 
inception the journal was intended for the working woman. After several lapses in 
publication, the journal reappeared in 1923 as a party-initiated response to numerous 
popular, non-Party journals, which had appeared in 1922.90 Although the number of 
issues ranged from twelve annually (1923, 1943-1991) to sixty (1931), the journal 
never ceased publication during the Soviet period, regardless of war, the Thaw,

journal predates the Soviet Union, having first appeared in March of 1914, only to be shut down by 
censors in June of the same year. It was an instant success, with all 12,000 copies bought up almost 
immediately. A committee of prominent Communist women, Praskovia Kudelli, Konkordia 
Samoilova, Liudmila Menzhinskaia, Anna Elizarova, Inessa Armand, Nadezhda Krupskaia, Lilina 
Zinovieva, Liudmila Stal‘, served on its editorial board. The journal was reissued shortly after the 
February revolution, in May of 1917, and proved to be so popular, its print run was increased from 
40,000 to 50,000 copies until it ceased publication in January, 1918, due to a paper shortage, and was 
replaced by women‘s pages in party newspapers.

stagnation, and perestroika.91 Its content reflected the state‘s position toward gender 
roles and by examining Rabotnitsa, one understands the message projected toward 
the average Soviet woman. It is highly likely that images of militarized women 
featured in the journal encouraged women of all ages to prepare themselves for a war 
in the near future. 
Samolet and Osoaviakhim, both organs of the Osoaviakhim civil defense 
organization, attracted a readership of both professionals and amateurs who were 
interested in aviation and weaponry. Samolet was published semi-monthly, with 
some irregularities, especially toward the commencement of World War II, from 
1923 until 1941.92 Osoaviakhim, which was renamed Voroshilovskii strelok in 1934, 
appeared biweekly between 1929 and 1940, except for the years 1930 and 1931, in 
which thirty-six issues appeared each year. Neither journal resumed publication after 
the war.93 
The role of the militarized woman in the “great family” 
Throughout the 1930s journalists repeatedly described women who 
participated in military activities as patriotic, .loyal daughters. of the Soviet Union, 
the Communist Party, and Stalin. The metaphor of the .great family. was a 
characteristic part of Soviet national mythology in the 1930s and both provided the 
state a new set of symbols to replace 1920s machine symbols as well as supported

the hierarchical structure of society.94 These daughters were not unlike the .sons,. a 
cadre of extraordinary people who achieved great victories and completed recordbreaking 
feats, such as mountain-climbing or long-distance flight.95 The younger 
generation of .children,. regardless of their sex, were motivated by a desire to 
prepare to defend their nation, ambition to achieve new victories, and love for their 
Motherland. An obituary of Hero of the Soviet Union Polina Osipenko concludes 
with the following paragraph, which includes many of the propagandistic clichés of 
the 1930s: ....... ...... .... ...... ...... ......... . ...... ....... 
.. ....... ..—.... ...... ...., ........... ......., ........... ...... 
.. ........ .. ..... ........ .......... ......, .. ..... ....... 
................ ....... (.Polina Osipenko ardently loved her Motherland. And 
the Motherland will never forget her—a loyal daughter, a heroic pilot, who 
completed victory after victory in glory of the great Soviet people, in the name of the 
great socialist country.).96 Through such obituaries and articles, women were led to 
conclude that by transcending traditional boundaries of domestic space, they were 
behaving patriotically and lovingly toward the .great family.. Although the 1930s 
saw a conservative return to the nuclear family, when interests collided, the .great 
family,. based on political ties, retained a much higher place in the hierarchy than 
the family based on blood kinship.97 This dominance of the .great family. over the 
individual nuclear family explains why not having children or leaving children with

relatives while fulfilling the military missions became an accepted woman‘s choice 
by the end of the 1930s. Although motherhood was revered, .true daughters. put 
their service to the state above their personal, familial happiness, just as Raskova and 
Grizodubova had. 
Party officials, according to Krylova, assigned national roles to different 
generations and the young generation had been allocated the military, protective 
role.98 In an article explaining her participation in civil defense, pilot and Voroshilov 
sharpshooter, Stakhanovka Lankova, argues that each young man and woman must 
give his or her .burning energy. to the homeland, or .great family,. since the 
Communist Party and Stalin have given them such happy lives.99 Lankova‘s article 
shows that the .great family‘s. daughters were just as responsible for defense of the 
homeland as the sons were and that all children should be prepared to pick up arms 
to defend the homeland, explicitly stating that sex should not affect the manner in 
which they contribute to the .great family.. 
The title of a Rabotnitsa article about one of Polina Osipenko‘s, Vera 
Lomako‘s, and Marina Raskova‘s non-stop flight of 2,416 kilometers, explicitly 
identifies the three women‘s positions within the .great family:. .Heroic Daughters

.great family. is proud of its warrior daughters, and their heroic victories. 
Soviet rhetoric supported women‘s training in the arts of war and legitimized 
participation in traditionally male activities by incorporating the image of the woman 
warrior into the greater mythology of the 1930s. Through rhetoric related to the 
.great family,. journalists counteracted conservative tendencies to doubt armed 
women and reject them as .other.. By emphasizing the fact that women took up 
arms and completed great feats solely as .patriotic daughters who loved their 
country,. they recalled the traditional loyalty Russian women were expected to show 
to their families as dutiful, loving daughters. 
Messages in Popular Magazines 
From the first years of publication, prominent journals of civil defense 
organizations (Samolet, Osoaviakhim) and women‘s journals featured images of 
armed women and articles supporting women‘s participation in civil defense. 
Between the start of Voroshilov‘s nation-wide militarization campaign in 1926 and 
the beginning of the war, Rabotnitsa, Osoaviakhim, and Samolet printed hundreds of 
images of women who either participated in civil defense or were soldiers. Between

1927 and June of 1941, Rabotnitsa depicted miilitarized women in 18 sketches, 354 
photos, and on 22 covers. Between 1929 and 1940, Samolet printed 57 photos and 4 
sketches and Osoaviakhim/ Voroshilovskii strelok printed 2 sketches, 187 photos, 26 
front covers, and 10 back covers featuring women soldiers. 
Photographs in the media often included young men and women together, 
either as snipers or in classrooms, learning the basics of aviation and mehcanics. As 
Krylova argues, these images demonstrated men‘s and women‘s equal ability to 
wage war.102 Furthermore, by including groups of volunteers, editors showed that 
engagement in military training was more than a solitary pastime, it was a collective 
activity, part of the arming of the state as a whole. In 1927, E. Demezer even argued 
that a mixed gender military would be stronger than an all-male military: .... .. 
... .......... ............ ...... ........ .. ....... .. ..... 
......., ....... .......... ......, ... ......—....... . ........., 
....... . ........ (.There is no need for us to organize women separately 
from men. We will be stronger, working as a united mass, all together, male and 
female workers, men and women.).103 Through photographs and articles, editors 
presented armed women in a manner that conveyed not only equality of sexes on the 
battlefield and the collective nature of militarization, but also the compatibility of 
women and warfare.

A February 1938 issue of Rabotnitsa featured a pictorial spread of twelve 
youthful, smiling women pilots. This image expresses the collective nature of 
military activities, while deconstructing traditional gender divisions with its title. 
The title .Proud Falcons of Our Motherland. (....... ...... ..... .......) 
encourages women to participate in traditional men‘s spheres. Meanwhile the editor 
chose the image of the falcon, a bird that in folklore traditionally represents male 
fighters. A short paragraph informs the reader that the Great October Revolution had 
given women equal rights and these patriotic women have chosen to exercise their 
equal rights in defending their homeland. The pictorial spread, accompanied by title 
and a paragraph explaining women‘s rights, shows that some members of the .new. 
society—presumably women, since they comprised Rabotnitsa.s intended 
audience— needed convincing that women belonged in civil defense, in particular, in 
aviation.104 
One finds a progression from the late 1920s into the early 1940s in 
Rabotnitsa, as the Soviet press and military eventually accepted what Krylova calls 
an .alternative gender personality..105 This newly constructed gender identity 
combined traditionally feminine and masculine qualities. For instance, in a 1927 
issue of Rabotnitsa, E. Chernyshova describes armed feminine bodies: ..... 
......., ......., ......,/ . ..... ......, ... .....,/ .. ....... ....... 
......../ ..-.. ...... ........ ....... (.They were slender, young, and

beyond narrow maidenly shoulders.).106 Clearly, the narrator must have felt as 
though there was something contradictory about armed women and felt the need to 
validate them. 
By the end of the 1930s, Chapichev presents a different portrait of the woman 
warrior: 
... ..... . ..... 
... ....... ....! 
........., ...... ....., 
........ . ..... 
...... .. ........ 
..... ... ......... ......! 
(There is nothing better or more beautiful 
Than our young women! 
Full of heroism and courage, 
Calm and proud 
Record after record 
They break for the Soviet country!)107 
Chapichev summarizes the desired characteristics in the new Soviet young woman: 
heroism, steadiness, pride, endurance, and skill on an international, rather than 
domestic, scale. Suddenly, there was no contradiction between women and the 
military. Within the span of a decade, authors and the media had fully embraced the 
idea of the woman warrior as natural and patriotic. The propagandization, 
development, and eventual acceptance of an alternative gender personality are 
apparent in visual representations throughout the militarization period.

Some women might have initially been reluctant to enter military training, 
thinking that to engage in combat is unbecoming to a woman. Through images, the 
journals conveyed the important message that beauty and weaponry were not 
incompatible. While women pilots were usually photographed in requisite flight 
suits, women pictured with guns were almost always wearing dresses and looking 
traditionally .feminine.. The first Rabotnitsa cover to feature armed women, in July 
1927, features a photograph of three women and one man, almost cut out of the 
picture.108 The three women are shooting from different positions, but all are 
wearing skirts and have uncovered, chin-length hair. There is nothing manly in their 
appearance. The magazine emphasizes the message that the acquisition of a rifle and 
shooting skills does not make a woman less of a woman. (figure 2) 
Journal editors also included sketches that illustrated fictional works about 
armed women. The sketch that accompanies Aleksei Tolstoi‘s 1938 excerpt, 
.Agrippina Chebrets,. shows a shapely young woman, striding forward, staring 
through the target finder of a rifle. The literary portrayal and visual depiction of the 
young woman, Agrippina Chebrets, creates the image of an able, strong, determined, 
yet beautiful and graceful woman (figure 3).109 
One can find extreme examples of the combination of weaponry and 
traditional constructs of femininity in images of armed mothers. Throughout the 
prewar militarization period Voroshilovskii strelok had published several 
photographs of these mothers. For example, an October 1939 issue of the magazine 
108 ......... 18 (July 1927): cover. 
109 ......., .......... ......,. 16. 

53 
published the photo of E. M. Ivanchik, who had taken second place in the men‘s [sic] 
group in a Tashkent shooting competition.110 She is wearing a woman‘s blouse, 
resting a rifle against her shoulder with her muscular, right hand, holding a smiling 
infant in her left arm. Another smiling child stands next to Ivanchik. The mother‘s 
military activities clearly do not interfere with her role as a mother. Perhaps, her 
children are happy and secure in the knowledge that their mother loves her country 
and them enough to prepare to protect them in the impending war (figure 4). 
Similarly, the back cover of a 1940 issue of Voroshilovskii strelok depicts a 
smiling, middle-aged mother in women‘s clothes, standing to the right of her happy, 
well-dressed, son, roughly twelve years old. The woman holds a rifle in her left arm, 
again indicating that the art of shooting is not only an appropriate pastime of young 
women, but that it is compatible with motherhood. This cover, like the other, shows 
that an armed woman can also be a loving and attentive mother (figure 5).111 
These images illustrate a narrative, imposed from above, that argued 
throughout the years that women and war were compatible and that dedicated 
daughters of the state should arm themselves, regardless of their stations in life. The 
magazines published photos and articles in celebration of armed schoolteachers, 
housewives, factory workers, and students, reiterating that the state‘s position on 
military preparedness meant that every able adult should be able to fight. 
Some photographers emphasized women‘s formidability and their threat to a 
potential enemy, prepared for any armed conflict. Such was the cover of the fifth

54 
issue of the inaugural 1929 year of Osoaviakhim, the first issue of that magazine to 
feature an armed woman on its cover, in honor of March 8, International Women‘s 
Day. The woman warrior narrows her eyes and slightly purses her lips, focusing her 
gaze on the near distance to the left of the viewer. Her right hand grasps the strap of 
her rifle and a small bag, presumably holding ammunition, hangs around her neck. 
Her hair is tied back under a scarf, so it does not distract her from her task at hand. 
Her jacket is rather unisex, reminding one of a military uniform. The woman stands 
in front of a factory, perhaps her workplace, showing that she will fiercely defend 
her nation and its industries, if attacked (figure 6).112 
A 1936 photograph, above an article .The Women Team‘s Prize-pennant. 
(.....-...... ....... .......) features a line of six crouching women, 
participants in the Central Sharp-shooting School in Kuskov. The women are 
dressed in Red Army trousers, although it is unlikely they would have been official 
soldiers. All six aim their bayoneted guns into the distance and squint into their 
viewfinders. Although the women are crouching in snow, their right hands are bare, 
with fingers on the triggers. The women appear calm and ready for an attacking line 
of soldiers (figure 7).113 
While images and articles in the press often emphasized the collectivity and 
camaraderie of military service, editors sometimes attempted to motivate women by 
drawing attention to the individual experience of military training, especially 
aviation and parachuting. Although militarization was a top-down, state-mandated

55 
policy, in some images, symbols of the state are noticeably absent. Perhaps editors 
realized that different women were motivated through different means. Images, such 
as the cover of Flame (Ogonek), September 10, 1936, emphasized personal ambition 
and passion for flying.114 On this cover, E. Kurasova, a factory worker and flight 
club participant, stands alone before a plane, and looks to the distance.115 Kurasova 
appears self-assured, independent, and strong. She stands alone with her plane 
(figure 8). 
Kheleva‘s poem .Female Pilot. (........,.1939) mirrors this emphasis on 
individual pilots‘ prowess. The first twenty-one verses of twenty-five describe the 
pilot‘s experience of flight. Written from the first-person perspective, the narrator 
emphasizes the isolation of the pilot in the sky and her individual actions: .. 
......./ ...... ..... ........../ .... ...... ........... ........ (.I flew/ 
.y light, silver plane/ .ver hundred of kilometers.).116 The poem describes the 
pilot‘s sense of excitement: ... . ..... ......../ . ..... ....../ . .....,/ 
........ ...... .... (.I leave on a new path,/ With a new feeling,/ I worry every 
time.).117 However, despite her interest in the pilot‘s private experience, Kheleva, 
aware of the purpose of literature, includes the state in her conclusion and reminds 
the reader that the pilot never flies alone, but always with the Motherland: ... ....

Journalists not only celebrated women warriors for their individual 
accomplishments, but, as mentioned before, they emphasized the collective nature of 
military activities. A 1930 Osoaviakhim cover stresses the camaraderie of civil 
defense participants.119 The cover depicts teamwork, showing a sketch of two 
women, dressed in identical women‘s uniforms, pulling a machine gun. The women 
are smiling, obviously enjoying each other‘s company as well as their work. The 
foreground of a 1935 cover of Voroshilovskii strelok depicts a robust, smiling 
woman, wearing a fitted women‘s short-sleeved sweater, grasping a bayoneted rifle 
in her right hand. A demonstration of military and athletic prowess on Red Square 
fills the background of the cover. Hundreds of citizens organized into formations are 
taking part in the demonstration. The young woman appears happy and proud to be 
a part of the greater militarization of her country (figure 9).120 The message 
conveyed by the March 1931 cover of Hygiene and Health of the Worker and 
Peasant Family (....... . ........ ....... . ............ .....), a journal of 
hygiene and popular medicine, is even more explicit: a radiant woman holding a 
bayoneted rifle close to her face stands in front of buildings bearing the sign 
.USSR..121 The message is that the Soviet woman is an armed woman. She is not 
only a part of the Soviet state, but is defined by it. These covers drive home the

message that those participating in military activities were part of a larger movement 
of like-minded patriots (figure 10). 
An examination of printed materials shows us that during the 1920s and 
1930s, popular magazines participated in the nation-wide redefinition of beauty. 
Traditionally, Russians prized plump women with exaggerated maternal features: 
large breasts and broad hips.122 After the revolution, the creators of mass culture 
reevaluated beauty and began celebrating a new body type: the young woman who 
is strong, robust, athletic, slim, agile, and tough. Large breasts suddenly became 
passé, even pornographic. As an example of the new aesthetic, Mikhail and August 
Shtern use Ilf and Petrov‘s portrayal of the Soviet attitude toward women‘s bodies 
in a fictional conversation between a poster artist and an art editor in a 1932 short 
story, ............ (Savanarylo.): 123

had changed.126 Editors included a variety of body types in their magazines, but 
often women either looked androgynous or their breasts and hips were deemphasized 
by women‘s clothing or their positions. For example, in honor of International 
Women‘s Day 1930, the editors of Osoaviakhim chose a sketch of an armed woman 
for the cover. The larger-than-life figure in a skirt and jacket, her hair mostly

covered, firmly grips her rifle. Her feet are firmly planted in the industrial town, her 
body towering above the factory. Armed, ready for combat, this superhero embodies 
strength. Her lean body shows that she is likely a worker, the ideal New Soviet 
Woman. Her larger than life depiction shows that her military training has allowed 
her to achieve new heights in Soviet Society, to become a better Soviet citizen 
(figure 11).127 
In actuality, the new Soviet ideal of beauty had less to do with a woman‘s 
physical attributes and was much more closely related to the combination of national 
spirit (..........) and .party-mindedness. (...........) that were part of the 
new socialist realist recipe for Soviet art and literature. Young women demonstrated 
their party-mindedness by arming themselves in preparation for the impending great 
battle for communism, proving that they were loyal daughters of their Soviet 
fatherland. Simultaneously, they were driven by a spontaneity which motivated 
them to take to the sky or strive for near perfection at the shooting range. Images, 
such as the cover of Rabotnitsa, no. 27, 1939, emphasized personal ambition and 
passion for flying.128 On this cover, Veronika Struchko, a flight instructor in a 
Leningrad flight club, wearing a flight suit and parachute, stands in front of a plane, 
looking up at the sky. Struchko appears self-assured, independent, and strong. 
There are no symbols of the state, no factories, no mausoleum. Struchko herself 
represents partiinost. and narodnost. characteristic of the New Soviet Person (figure 
12).

Beauty was newly defined by accomplishments and courage. In a 1934 
poem, Iaroslav Mukhin describes a woman‘s transformation when she pulls on a 
flight suit: 
...—.......... . ...... ......

(The world is wider with every year.

The weather in the country 
Is of first freshness and warmth. 
You became even more beautiful 
When you donned glasses and your helmet, 
And an expensive costume of metal 
Sewn by the Motherland on the earth.)129 
The author associates her beauty with her flight suit, which marks her as a 
parachutist. In this transfigurative moment, a young woman becomes a full-fledged 
.woman warrior.. In his collection of propaganda posters Aleksandr Snopkov 
(2004) describes 1930s interest in aviation: ....... ...... . ....... ........

and women have given all of their free time to the study of flight and parachuting:

chest drew all the more attention.).130 Authors also linked beauty with courage and 
battle-ready firmness of mind. Leonid Ambakh concludes his poem .The Female 
Parachutist. (..............) with the lines: .. ..... ........ . .... ....../ 
.. . ... ........ ..... ......../ ........, ........ . .......!. (.Again I 
looked in your eyes/ But in them shine bright innovation/ Persistence, courage and 
beauty!.)131 
By 1938, the public admired the militarized woman to the extent that she 
became a celebrity. Her image was so recognizable that she was even used to sell 
beauty products. For example, in his advertisement, I. Bograd featured a female 
pilot to sell Sanit brand toothpaste.132 The poster features a pilot, who resembles 
Grizodubova, smiling a bright smile, her teeth the same shade of white as her plane‘s 
exhaust. She exudes health, youth, joy for life, and personal accomplishment. 
Clearly, a woman pilot is a happy, beautiful woman, and those selling Sanit believed 
that women would buy their toothpaste in the hopes of looking look like her. 
Bograd‘s poster shows us that by 1938, the woman warrior had not only become a 
role model to be imitated, but had redefined standards of beauty. 
Editorial boards actively portrayed armed women in a manner that would 
inspire other women, as an open letter to women aviators from the editors of 
Rabotnitsa shows: .... ....... ... ...... ........... ........ . ....

(.Your heroism inspires women workers and all Soviet women even more to the 
battle for new victories of the socialist Motherland.).133 Upon the completion of 
aviation records, women pilots were often featured on the covers of Rabotnitsa, as 
they became exemplary women (figures 13 and 14).134 
Editors also included stories about individual women‘s journeys toward 
militarization, showing that an average woman could become a warrior. In these 
vignettes, journalists would describe the experience of typical women, for example: 
.. 20 ... ... ........ ..... .. .......... .. ..... ...... .........

.. ...., .... .... ......... ...... (... 20 years of age Ania Baranova was no 
different from thousands of other young Soviet women. Energetic and life-loving, 
she shamed her friends who did not know what to do with their spare time.).135 The 
author then proceeds to describe Baranova‘s path from fear of touching a rifle to 
becoming a .passionate shot. (.......... ........), instructor, and a master of 
shooting in three years. The article discounts those who initially doubted Baran and 
concludes with an image of Baranova as a true fighter, after her transformation: 
........, ........., . ....... ....., ... .......... ...........

the impression of a real fighter, who will not lose her head during a sudden meeting 
with the enemy, someone who will stand for herself and her Motherland. Ania‘s 
dream is to become a sniper and to prove herself in action, if war were to erupt.).136 
The author of the article obviously intends for it to be read by an ordinary woman 
looking for a hobby, and much like the personal testimonies, this article shows 
women how to become fighters. 
Throughout the militarization period, magazines warned readers about 
women‘s military preparations in capitalist countries. In 1928, the .Abroad. (... 
........) section of Rabotnitsa featured pictures of riflewomen in the United 
States and England and a report of women‘s military activities in several European 
countries. Levakova reminded her readers: .... .. ....-.. ....... .......... 
...... .. ....... .... ...... ....... ..... .......... . ..........., 
..... ........ ..... ........ ...... . .... ....... ...... ........ 
............ (.Our female workers and peasants must remember the military 
preparation of women going on abroad. Our female citizens face huge tasks in 
defending our country in their workplaces.).137 As capitalist women in potentially 
hostile countries were preparing themselves for war, Soviet women also needed to 
match and outdo their efforts. 
While publications addressing primarily female readers emphasized a 
woman‘s right and duty to fly or bear weapons and encouraged her participation in 
military training, some articles in journals read mostly by men, like Samolet, 
136 Ibid. 
137.. ........, ... .......: ....... .......... ........ ......... 25 (1928): 5. 

64 
addressed men and argued for women‘s inclusion in the civil defense organizations. 
These articles indicate, and postwar pilots‘ memoirs confirm, that, in spite of the 
government's official position, in reality, many men continued to view aviation as a 
man‘s realm and tried hard to exclude women. As a result, many female pilots were 
forced to overcome opposition and serious gender-based discrimination on the part 
of aviation officials. Since the inclusion of women in the 1920s-1930s militarization 
was a top-down decision and policies were often contradictory, conservative 
reluctance to accept women as equals is not surprising.138 Regardless of images of 
smiling women in flight suits, the vast majority of women pilots needed to show 
stubborn determination in order to learn how to fly. 
Some of the articles and letters from editorial boards in popular magazines 
such as Samolet, whose intended audience included both men and women, show that 
discrimination existed on every level of society, including civilian organizations. 
Although the official position deemed these individuals .old-fashioned thinkers,. the 
military also did not recognize a woman‘s equal right to participate in aviation 
alongside men. 
Women encountered much less discrimination when learning to shoot or 
handle large weapons, like machine guns, perhaps because weapons were not as 
expensive or complicated as planes. It is also likely that they did not encounter as

65 
much opposition as the pilots did, since being a pilot was much more prestigious 
than a rifleman or riflewoman. Not surprisingly, Osoaviakhim/ Voroshilovskii 
Strelok rarely included articles or editorials, addressed toward men, reiterating a 
woman‘s right and duty to participate in defense and demanding her inclusion in 
military activities. These articles were likely not needed. 
Throughout the late 1920s and 1930s, magazines published photographs that 
featured young women, looking happy and confident, proud of their 
accomplishments. Media images advocated strong, able, confident women who took 
full advantage of the equal rights supposedly afforded to them by their Soviet 
Motherland, women who were not afraid to venture into a world previously the 
domain of men. Editors hailed these women as true daughters of the Soviet Union 
and the Communist Party. 
Positive images and celebratory articles of militarized women encouraged 
girls and young women growing up in the 1930s Soviet Union to engage in military 
activities. Nadezhda Kravtsova's description of Olga Iamshchika‘s experience of 
1930s militarization gives evidence of the influence media images had on the 
generation of women that would become fighter pilots in World War II.139 In 
Kravstova‘s biography, Iamshchika is inspired by media images of pilots, cuts out 
their photos, thus in a sense transforming these heroes into icons. She dreams of 
becoming a pilot:

(Lost in thought, Lel‘ka looked through the window and nibbled on the tip of 
her pen. At home she kept newspaper clippings with pictures of airplanes, 
and news about the long-distance flights of pilots Gromov, Moiseev. Uncle 
Misha, the one person, whom Lel‘ka had told about her dream, had brought 
her several old issues of Samolet, and now she knew the entire history of 
aviation. She know that in 1911, before she was even alive, in the Gatchino 
flight school, outside of Petersburg, three Russian women learned how to fly. 
The first to receive her diploma was the pilot Lidiia Zvereva, the daughter of 
a Russian general. She became an instructor in the Riga flight school, but 
after several years, she died of typhus. Almost at the same time, the actress 
Liubov‘ Galanchikova finished the flight school. A year later, she went with 
the flight aircraft designer Fokker to Germany, where she continued to fly on 
his plane and even set a altitude record ... These were the first Russian 
women pilots. And not long ago at all, Lel‘ka cut out from the newspaper 
Krasnaia gazeta a 1925 notice, with a portrait, about Zinaida Kokorina, the 
first woman military pilot. Kokorina in a helmet with a star, a pretty face, 
looks serious. Lel‘ka learned the entire article by heart, and especially 
remembered the concluding words: .On the international day of the worker 
and peasant of our Union, we must fimly understand for ourselves that 
Kokorina was only the first, but not the last. She proved that a woman could 

67 
be a pilot.… Remembering all this, Lel‘ka had already several times thought 
that if Zinaida Kokorina was able to finish a military aviation academy, 
become an instructor, teach others, then surely, she, Lel‘ka would be able to 
do the same?)140 
In this excerpt, assuming that Iamshchikova‘s experience was typical and that 
thousands of women reacted in similar manners to the state-wide militarization 
campaign, Kravtsova shows the role the media played. Examples of pilots, first male 
and then female, inspired Iamshchika to the extent that she canonized them, cutting 
out their pictures and transforming them into icons.141 Photographs showed the 
nation that the women pilots were pleasant, serious professionals to be admired. 
Aviation magazines like Samolet taught novices about the history and mechanics of 
aviation before they entered flight clubs. From articles and images in the media 
women learned that not only was an aviation career a possibility but that women 
before them had set precedents and proven that women could fly. These women 
concluded that armed women warriors were patriotic daughters in a .great family,. 
ready and eager to wage war in the next great battle for communism. 
When Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union June 22, 1941, the Soviet 
Union‘s contradictory position toward armed women and rejection of their demands 
to go to the front led to frustration and confusion. For over a decade, the Soviet state 
had urged women to prepare for a foreign invasion, yet, hundreds of thousands of 
militarized women, fully prepared and eager to defend their Motherland were sent

home to await mobilization while their male comrades, with whom they had studied 
aviation and weaponry, were accepted into the Red Army immediately. 
The first women to be accepted by the military were those in noncombat 
roles-nurses, reconnaissance scouts, radio operators, and translators. Eventually the 
military mobilized snipers, machine gunners, and pilots. Throughout the war, 
journals continued to feature images of armed women, but only months into the war 
it became clear that the most celebrated women warriors would be those who had not 
distinguished themselves through skilled fighting, but by sacrificing themselves for 
the homeland.

By far, the most widely celebrated Soviet woman warrior remains the martyr. 
These words, allegedly proclaimed by Zoia Kosmodemian‘skaia as Nazi soldiers 
were tightening the noose around her neck, illustrate crucial aspects of the woman 
warrior-martyr myth in Stalinist culture. It focuses on bravery in death: a warrior‘s 
farewell to comrades-in-arms who will avenge her, a martyr‘s willingness to die for 
the Soviet people, a demand that Soviets mobilize and avenge her death, and a 
reference to Stalin, the spiritual father, at the moment of her death. The title of this 
chapter and the epigraph seemingly comprise a contradiction: the partisan is famous 
both for her stoic silence in the face of torture and for her stirring final speech to her 
comrades. This chapter aims to resolve this contradiction and explain how it 
functions in the warrior-martyr myth.

Who is the woman warrior-martyr in the context of Soviet culture? She is a 
soldier who is remembered for her inspiring death for the Soviet cause, rather than 
for heroic deeds. Usually she is a partisan or reconnaissance scout. During World 
War II, narratives and images of woman warrior-martyrs helped to motivate citizens, 
bring the Soviet citizenry together, and mold them as a nation. The impact of Zoia 
on Soviet culture is more obvious than any other martyr. Her death inspired many: 
Hero of the Soviet Union and pilot Marina Raskova, the partisan Oleg Koshevoi, 
who later himself was executed as commissar of the Krasnodon underground group 
.the Young Guard. [....... .......] and the tank driver Mariia Oktiabrskaia, 
who later bought a tank to avenge the death of her husband and other Soviet 
compatriots. Readers cut Zoia‘s picture out of Pravda and framed it, transforming 
her image into an icon. To the present day, .To keep quiet, like a partisan. 
(........, ... ...........) is a common idiom conveying resolute silence. It 
originates particularly from women partisans‘ silence in the face of interrogation by 
the Nazis. One of the main characteristics of the partisan was his or her strong 
silence in the face of torture. 
This chapter will treats the process of and reasons for the creation of the 
woman warrior-martyr myth in Soviet culture. It also examines the warrior-martyr‘s 
reception by the Soviet public in an attempt to explain why the partisans made such a 
lasting impression on the Soviet public. It examines the World War II warriormartyr 
in terms of character (typical traits, motivation, kinship relations), cultural 
precursors/mentors and heritage, and settings (nature, village, or city). I outline key 

71 
elements of the warrior-martyr master plot and examine the concept of time in this 
story (epic time, crisis time, mythic timelessness). Further discussion will focus on 
the most famous example, Zoia Kosmodem‘ianskaia, and the process of 
mythmaking. My goal is to explain the powerful impact she had on the Russian 
collective memory of World War II rather than other women—pilots, snipers, and 
tank drivers—who accomplished more and died even more heroic deaths. 
The woman warrior-martyr may be defined as a hero, either fictional or based 
on a real-life prototype, who is usually tortured and dies for the Motherland, having 
fought for Communist .truth. and for the Russian people, against a formidable 
enemy. She becomes a national hero through death, rather than military deeds. Her 
death, her sacrifice for the Motherland, for Communism, for Stalin, for the people, 
for ideological truth, and for the future, overshadows the rest of her biography, 
including her achievements and military actions. She contributes to the war effort 
primarily by dying for her nation. Works about women warrior-martyrs typically 
include lengthy descriptions of the martyr‘s last moments, often detailing physical 
torture, last words, and execution. She is remembered by future generations as a 
.true daughter of the Motherland. who sacrificed herself for the Soviet Union after 
living a .moral. life in the Soviet context, which meant believing in Communist 
doctrine and behaving correctly.144 Prior to World War II warrior-martyrs in Soviet 
mythology were those individuals—men or women—who had sacrificed their lives 
144 Women warrior-martyrs are often referred to as .true daughters of the Motherland,. as evident in 
the title of I. Cherniaeva‘s ...... ...... (......: ............ .......... ......,. 1975) and

1942): 2. 

72 
for the Communist cause in the war against the tsarist regime: nineteenth-century 
revolutionaries and heroes of the Civil War.145 
Soviet ideologues transferred religious rituals and types—here the notion of 
the martyr—in secular form to their new atheist state. In keeping with this 
transference, the Soviet definition of the martyr is broader than the established 
definition of martyr as a person who died in imitation of Christ after defending his or 
her Christian faith when persecuted by Roman authorities.146 Arthur Droge and 
James Tabor identify five characteristics of the martyr: 
1. The individual reflects situations of opposition and persecution. 
2. The choice to die, which this individual makes, is viewed by authors as 
necessary, noble, and heroic. 
3. This individual is often eager to die; indeed, in several cases martyrs end 
up directly killing themselves. 
4. There is often the idea of vicarious benefit resulting from their suffering 
and death. 
5. The expectation of vindication and reward beyond death, more often than 
not, is a prime motivation for the choice of death.147 
One finds examples of all five of these characteristics in the corpus of works about 
women warrior-martyrs. 
I begin my analysis of the woman warrior with the martyr type because this 
category is the most widespread type of woman warrior in Soviet cultural history 
related to World War II. The first female Hero of the Soviet Union during the war, 
145 For example, see Catherine Merridale‘s discussion of the postrevolutionary .pantheon. of new 
Soviet saints in her book, Night of Stone: Death and Memory in Nineteenth-Century Russia. (New 
York: Viking, 2000) and Nina Tumarkin‘s analysis of veneration of Lenin in Lenin Lives! The Lenin 
Cult in Soviet Russia (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1983).

the school girl and partisan, Zoia Kosmodemian‘skaia, was a martyr.148 The most 
famous women heroes were martyrs. These women became saints in the Soviet 
iconostasis that gave Soviets and model into a believe system in which the 
totalitarian dictator was God. I am going to examine the process by which these 
martyrs became saints and then discuss in more detail Kosmodem‘ianskaia, the most 
clear-cut example of the construction of a cultural myth. 
Although some might question the significance of certain women warriormartyrs 
who contributed seemingly little to the Soviet cause, we must pay attention 
to the martyr texts because of the central role these women play in Russian cultural 
memory. The number of published works about the martyred schoolgirl Zoia 
Kosmodemian‘skaia far exceeds the number of published works about other famous 
woman warriors like the pilot Marina Raskova, one of the first Heroes of the Soviet 
Union and captain and organizer of women‘s air regiments. The martyr texts are 
not merely narratives of actions, completed for the war effort; rather, actions are 
secondary to the message of selfless devotion and boundless love for the homeland. 
Shortly after the start of the Second World War, the exemplary Soviet woman 
transmogrified from the strong, active, arms-bearing woman of the 1930s into a 
martyr. 
This chapter hypothesizes that the martyr was a genuinely popular type; 
Soviet officials at first did not orchestrate the development of the heroic model for 
women from an armed woman into a martyr. The officials did not anticipate the 
148 .. .. ......., .......... .. ..........: ....... ...... . ...... (......: .......,

74 
public‘s response. For example, although journalists did shape the first reports of 
Zoia‘s death to elicit widespread public rage, they omitted key facts about Zoia‘s 
death. Nonetheless, once they saw the reaction to the report of Zoia 
Kosmodemian‘skaia‘s torture and death, they manipulated the image of the martyred 
warrior as a means to motivate the Soviet people. Kosmodem‘ianskaia became the 
first woman Hero of the Soviet Union within a month of the release of her identity. 
Scholars of Soviet culture have referred to her as the .Joan of Arc of the Great 
Patriotic War,. even if underground leader Liza Chaikina‘s life bears a more striking 
resemblance to the French saint‘s life.149 
The warrior-martyr type is more pervasive, more multifaceted than other 
types of women who participated in World War II. We find her in literary and 
visual, narrative and lyrical texts, public and private spheres: documentary novella 
(.............. .......), vignette (.....), diary, memoir, letter, novel, long 
narrative fiction/prose, narrative poem, lyric poem, novina,150 film, play, sculpture 
(public and private), historical painting, political poster, and museum displays. 
Before building a typology of the warrior-martyr, it will be helpful to 
summarize the place of the martyr and the female martyr in Russian culture. 
Russians have a long tradition of venerating martyrs. One can trace martyrs back to 
149 See Nina Tumarkin, The Living and the Dead (New York: HarperCollins Publishers, 1994), 76; 
Rosalinde Sartorti, .On the Making of Heroes, Heroines, and Saints,. in Culture and Entertainment in

150 The novina is a faux-folkloric genre, structurally based on the medieval bylina, but about Soviet 
heroes and themes. See Frank J. Miller, Folklore for Stalin Russian Folklore and Pseudofolklore of 
the Stalin Era (New York: Armonk, 1990). 

75 
the Slavic, pre-Christian, pagan past. As Serge Zenkovsky argues, both native and 
Byzantine translations of hagiography provided stylistic and spiritual examples well 
into the nineteenth century.151 In East Slavic folklore, remnants of pagan sacrifice 
were preserved in calendrical rituals. The first Russian Orthodox patron saints, Boris 
and Gleb, were martyrs. They died model deaths, submitting to a higher truth, 
praying as they awaited fratricidal deaths. Female martyr saints figure prominently 
in pre-modern didactic literature; they are the most common, albeit, least developed, 
types of women engaged in religious life.152 
This veneration of the martyr transcended the Christian realm in the early 
nineteenth century, as the myth of the Decembrists and their wives developed among 
revolutionaries. The Decembrists‘ wives sacrificed their social standing and physical 
comfort in support of their imprisoned and exiled husbands.153 As radical 
revolutionary movements developed in the mid-to-late nineteenth century and radical 
revolutionaries began to employ terrorist tactics, revolutionaries were inspired by 
lives of revolutionaries who were either imprisoned or executed for their political 
deeds. Authors transformed old hagiographical forms into works that would fill a 
new socialist canon. These nineteenth century radicals not only influenced those 
who fought in the Civil War but also, women who participated in World War II. 
Vera Figner, for example, spent twenty-two years in solitary confinement for 
coordinating a political assassination shortly after the assassination of Alexander II.

During World War II, Zoia Rukhadze invoked Figner‘s name as she stood before 
German firing squad.154 Sofiia Perovskaia, the first female radical to be hanged, 
Zina Konoplianikova, and Lidiia Sture, the inspiration for Leonid Andreev‘s Musia, 
all willingly sacrificed themselves for the Communist cause and inspired subsequent 
generations of woman warriors.155 Clark notes that the revolutionaries aimed to be 
what N. K. Mikhailovskii termed .martyrs of history.: .Prison and exile, death from 
tuberculosis or some other debilitating disease, brought on by sacrificing one‘s 
health to the cause, separation of lovers and families—all became not traumatic 
limitations but opportunities for election. into the pantheon of Communist saints.156 
Soviet propagandists transformed into martyrs the unarmed workers who 
were killed on Bloody Sunday during the 1905 Revolution. In 1929, the Soviets 
exhumed the demonstrators‘ remains from a mass grave, placed them in coffins 
draped in red and reburied them in marked graves in a formal ceremony.157 
Lunacharskii articulated the Soviets‘ need to recapture the power of myth.158 In the 
1930s, the State published ritualized biographies of the Bolshevik elite, all of whom 
had suffered for the cause. Mark D. Steinberg notes that early Bolshevik writers 
often employed Christian imagery in narratives of violent struggles of the Civil

War.159 He maintains that authors portrayed proletarians as saints and as .crucified 
martyrs,. whose suffering would redeem humanity.160 Clearly, the martyr occupied 
a central position in Soviet culture even before the war. 
The direct precursors to the woman warrior-martyrs of World War II are 
women who participated in revolutionary movements and the Civil War. World War 
II warrior-martyrs often viewed these women as role models and imitated them. In 
particular, revolutionary martyrs‘ resolute silence in the face of torture particularly 
left an impact on the women of the next generation. Tat‘iana Solomakha, a 
schoolteacher and Civil War commissar, was imprisoned, tortured, and killed by 
White soldiers, all the while remaining fiercely silent. She reportedly impressed 
Zoia to the extent that Zoia assumed Solomakha‘s identity when she was 
interrogated by Nazis. When asked her name, Zoia only responded that her name 
was .Tania.. Zoia‘s mother, Liubov‘ Kosmodemian‘skaia, later wrote in her 
biography of Zoia The Tale of Zoia and Shura (....... . ... . ...., 1950), that 
Zoia cried when she read how the Whites beat Tania when she would not cry and 
how she did not ask them for mercy, all the while bravely looking them in their 
eyes.161 
These revolutionary predecessors proclaim inspiring words prior to their 
executions, as in the examples of Sonia Fadeeva and Kseniia Ge, whose last words 
prior before execution were ... ........... ......... ......!. (.Long live

Soviet power!.) 162 These warrior-martyrs for the bright Communist future, as well 
as women like Liusik Lisinova, hit by an enemy bullet in the Moscow Uprising of 
1917, provided examples and inspired the children who would become World War II 
warrior-martyrs.163 Because the type of warrior-martyr was strongly shaped by 
Soviet and Soviet-approved male heroes and historical figures, it is worth taking a 
moment to discuss these influences. Zoia, Liza Chaikina, and the two Young 
Guards, Ulia Gromova and Ina Konstantinova, all were well-read in Russian and 
Soviet literature and authors often portrayed them reading. Liubov‘ 
Kosmodem‘ianskaia describes the role of the book in her daughter‘s life: ......

in books is always Truth.‘—said Zoia when she was young. Now she would long 
think over a book, argue with it, find in the book an answer to that which disturbed 
her.).164 
Both Liza and Zoia aspired to be like Pavel Korchagin, the protagonist who 
sacrifices his health for the Soviet cause until his death, in Nikolai Ostrovskii‘s How 
the Steel Was Tempered (... .......... ....., 1932, 1934), a novel which was

impact of Ostrovskii on Zoia and her generation: ...... ...... . .... ........

the vignette about Tania Solomakha, that unforgettable story, the one that could not 
pass by a single teenager without leaving an impression—the story about Pavel 
Korchagin, about his bright and beautiful life. And it left a deep impression on the 
consciousness and hearts of my children.).165 Liza views World War II as part of an 
ongoing single war that began with the 1917 revolution: ....... ..., . ....... 
....... .........., .. ............ ............,. she says (.The battle, 
about which Ostrovskii speaks, is for the liberation of humanity.).166 Liza, like

loved ones, ...... ......., ... ..... ........ … .... ...... ......! 
........!. (.We will fight, like Pavka Korchagin ... while our hearts beat! We

I have already noted the impact of the Civil War commissar Solomakha on 
Zoia Kosmodem‘ianskaia. According to Liubov‘ Kosmodem‘ianskaia, Zoia was 
also moved by the stories of other patriots, both Soviet and pre-Soviet, such as the 
165 Ibid.

stories told by a friend‘s father, who fought with Chapaev in the Civil War.168 In 
Lev Arnshtam‘s film, Zoia recites a poem about the Russian hero, Ivan Susanin, who 
battled Polish invaders during the Time of Troubles and whom one might view as a 
prototype for the twentieth-century partisan. The inclusion of these cultural 
precursors in the biographies of woman warrior-martyrs indicates the martyr‘s role in 
a larger tradition. Her morally correct precursors have shown her how to act and 
what to believe, just as she will inspire future generations. 
As a young girl, Liuba Shevtsova, a member of the Young Guard dreamt of 
being Chapaev: ........, ... ...... .... . ........, ...... ........, . .. 
.....—............, ...... ..., ... .........., ... [....] .... 
......... ......... ... ........ .... .......... ... ...... ....... . 
....... . ........... .. ......... ...... (.However, she wanted to be 
Chapaev, not Anka the machine-gunner, due to her scorn for girls, but Chapaev. She 
painted herself a mustache using a burnt cork and fought with the boys until she 
won.).169 Liuba envisions herself as a fighter, and when the war begins, she is the 
only woman in Fadeev‘s novel who dreams of victorious feats at the front, either as a 
pilot or doctor, or perhaps behind the lines, as a reconnaissance scout and radio 
operator. Mythic Chapaev embodies her longing for glory through self-sacrifice. 
These childhood dreams foreshadow her participation in World War II. Authors 
seemingly include these sources of inspiration to show that these women started life 
as patriotic children, who were inspired by the victories that preceded them. The

81 
authors want their young readers to draw inspiration from stories of women warriormartyrs, 
so that they will be ready to continue the struggle for communism, seeing 
themselves as the next in a line of brave warriors for communism. 
Like her predecessors, the woman warrior-martyr is . model citizen, 
intensely patriotic, and loyal. Her love for her country and her dedication to the 
righteous struggle endow her with the strength and eagerness to sacrifice herself for 
the collective. The warrior-martyr type embodies a combination of the ordinary and 
the extraordinary. Often the narrator stresses the martyr‘s ordinariness as a child. 
She enjoys simple everyday pleasures, such as walking through Russian nature and 
reading books. And, just like the reader of the text, she is raised in the Soviet .great 
family. and attends Soviet schools. Ina Konstantinova, a partisan from Kashin, who 
kept a diary, published posthumously, before sacrificing herself for her comrades 
during a battle, does not stand out from her peers in photographs:

By stressing the average nature of the martyr, these works send the message that 
there is no reason why the reader of cannot also accomplish great deeds for the 
nation. 
However, as ordinary as she may be, the future warrior, like her forbears of 
Russian saints lives, almost always has a gift or behaves in a manner that sets her 
apart from other children. Often the martyr is intelligent or wise beyond her years. 
In her narrative poem .Liza Chaikina. Poema,. Maria Komissarova portrays Hero of 
the Soviet Union Liza Chaikina, executed November 23, 1941, as a little girl 
preferring to read over other childhood pastimes. The narrator emphasizes Liza‘s 
intelligence by contrasting to her with her less serious sister by showing Liza passing 
her sister a doll and opening a book.171 
An inner flame sets Zoia Kosmodem'ianskaia apart from her childhood peers: 
.... . ......... .... .. ...../ ..... .... ....... . ......../ ......

one not love her—so loving, responsive. Girls considered her rather odd.).173 
Although these warrior-martyrs differ from each other, narrators note that they 
distinguished themselves as special children, pointing to their noteworthy destinies. 
The woman warrior-martyr typically possesses all of the characteristics that 
good Soviet citizens do however, she demonstrates these characteristics to the 
extreme. For instance, she is so honest that sometimes she crosses the boundaries of 
polite behavior. When she knows the truth, she must openly proclaim it. Honesty is 
the dominant trait in Zoia Kosmodem‘ianskaia‘s character. In Margarita Aliger‘s 
narrative poem, Zoia, pravda (ideological truth) becomes Zoia‘s passion as she 
grows into an adult. In Aliger‘s plays and in Liubov‘ Kosmodem‘ianskaia‘s 
biography, Zoia risks social alienation when she informs on misbehaving classmates. 
She is forgiven only because they recognize her moral superiority that she holds 
herself to even stricter standards. Zoia tells her peers, .. . .. .... ....., .— 
.........., . ....... ........ ....... . ...., . ..... (.But I don‘t want to 
lie. I‘m a Komsomol member. I am obligated to speak the truth. And I will, I 
will.).174 Semen Tutuchenko writes about Ganna Bondarchuk, a peasant scout in 
Belorus: ......-.. ... ....... ........, ......, .............: ... ......, 
.. . ........ ........ ........, .......—... .. ...... ...... (.She was a 
little too open, straightforward, unsophisticated: what she thought, she would say.

84 
The smallest emotion, uneasiness—you could see everything in her eyes.).175 
Although an extreme dedication to honesty characterizes warrior-martyrs, they never 
give up any information to the Germans. They give the expression, .silent as a 
partisan,. its meaning. 
The woman warrior-martyr is unusually self-sacrificing from early childhood. 
Often, early in the work, the heroine strives to ignore her individual happiness in 
order to benefit another person or the greater good of the Soviet state. This selfsacrificing 
trait often manifests itself in oaths when the heroine enters the 
Komsomol, or Communist Youth League. In Fadeev‘s The Young Guard (....... 
......., 1946, 1951), the narrator describes actress and partisan Liuba: ... ....... 
..... ..... . ........ .... .................. ........ ...... . ....... 
........, ........, .............. .......—... ..... . ..... .. ......, ... 
...., ..... ...... .... ...-.. ..... . ..... ...... ..... .... . ....-.. 
........... (.A thirst for glory and the terrible strength of self-sacrifice tormented 
her. Mad courage and a feeling of childish, mischievous, piercing happiness called 
her forward, all the more higher so that there was always something new and so that 
there was always something for which to strive.).176 Several authors describe Zoia‘s 
childhood self-sacrifice, when she sacrifices her own pleasure to give to others: she 
might help other students with their school work, or baby-sit a neighbor‘s child, 
rather than going to a dance. The warrior-martyr is defined by her dedication to and

85 
need to sacrifice herself for her nation and the party. When dreaming of the future, 
she may not know exactly what she wants to become, only that she hopes to 
accomplish great deeds to benefit the Soviet Union. 
One of the primary differences between the woman warrior-martyr and a 
male martyr, like Oleg Koshevoi, is an emphasis on purity and innocence. In her 
novina, .We Won‘t Ever Forget. (... ...... ... ...-.......), E. I. Chichaeva 
uses the color white to symbolize Zoia‘s purity. Zoia has a white body, white hands, 
and a white face: her white body represents her pure soul.177 The narrator of The 
Young Guard describes the partisan martyr Ulia Gromova, who seemingly represents 
Russia herself, as .pure, clean. (chistaia), as well as .strong. (sil.naia). Innocence 
adds dimension to the martyr‘s sacrifice, just as it added to the value of human 
sacrifices in the premodern era. 
The warrior-martyr is fearless, never afraid of death. Fadeev describes one of 
the heroines of the Young Guard: ...... .... ....... ...... . ............ 
(.Liubka was a straightforward and fearless girl.).178 She may announce that she is 
not afraid to die, like Ganna Bondarchuk, who tells her interviewer when demanding 
transfer to the front, .. .. ..... ......, ...... .. ...... (.I am not afraid of 
death, I‘m not afraid of anything.).179 She may instruct others not to fear death. All 
of the works about Zoia detail her strength and bravery as she faces interrogation, 
torture, and execution. In Arnshtam‘s film, the viewer watches as Zoia develops this

86 
fearlessness as a child: portrayed as an only child home alone, Zoia forces herself to 
leave her bed and confront her fear of the dark. In her novina, E. I. Chichaeva 
includes Zoia‘s last words, in which Zoia addresses the Soviet people and demands 
that they also become fearless: ... .. ....... ....., ....., ........,/ . .. 
..... ... ....... .. .........,/ .. ....., .. ......, .. ........ .. .......!. 
(.=Do not fear torture, execution./ It is easy to die for the fatherland./ For the 
people, for the country, for comrade Stalin!‘.).180 
The warrior-martyr type has two sub-types, the simple peasant and the sly 
rogue. Her eloquence does not mean that the woman warrior-martyr was always 
portrayed as complex or cultured. Class rarely alters the portrayal of the woman 
warrior-martyr, but, if the martyr lacked a higher education and almost always if she 
came from the provinces, the narrator notes her simplicity. All martyrs lack 
pretension, but simplicity marks the peasant woman‘s character. She is direct and 
honest. Regardless of class origins, the warrior-martyrs are always intelligent. 
Birdiukov portrays Liza Chaikina as an ideal peasant: a woman with nothing more 
than basic schooling, but self-taught, and endowed with the ability to enlighten her 
family; she stands apart from other peasant girls in her thirst for knowledge and her 
understanding of the Party and ideological truth. After becoming a party leader, she 
maintains her ties to the kolkhoz and becomes the leader of the peasants during the 
Nazi occupation, precisely because she knows how to speak simply and clearly. 
180 ......., .. ...... ... ....-......, 6. 

87 
The other subtype of the woman warrior-martyr that merits discussion is the 
martyr-rogue or dissembler. The martyr rogue shares many characteristics with the 
martyr, but differs from the martyr in several key traits: mobility, cleverness, wit, 
inner purity, and honesty. She transgresses boundaries of ordinary behavior and uses 
trickery to accomplish tasks and undermine the enemy. 
Slyness sets the rogue apart from other martyrs. She is constantly moving 
between the Nazis and the Soviets, trying on new identities and deftly stealing 
things. She moves quickly. She also defies authority to an extent, creating her own 
rules as she plays a dangerous game of living on the fence. Often these characters 
move between two roles: the loyal Soviet citizen who hates the Nazis and the funloving 
girl who likes the Nazis because she hates the Soviets who somehow punished 
her family, usually her father. 
The rogue differs from the ordinary martyr because her actions are 
ambiguous—she is never straightforwardly honest and pure. She must be able to 
withhold information and lie, not only to Germans but to her Russian neighbors. All 
warrior-martyrs are smart, but the martyr rogue is unusually crafty. 
The rogue particularly uses her sexual desirability to facilitate reconnaissance 
work. Under normal circumstances, she would not be engaging in inappropriate 
sexual activities, but as she is willing to do anything to further the Soviet cause and 
gain valuable information or supplies from the Germans. Stories about rogues 
describe flirting, euphemistically hinting that the rogue is sleeping with the enemy. 

88 
Masha .Zoia. Poryvaeva, a scout in the partisan commander Arbuzov‘s 
brigade, goes on reconnaissance missions, bearing arms.181 She moves between 
three identities, Zoia the partisan, the peasant Agrafena from a kolkhoz, and the 
daughter of a formerly rich peasant who had been persecuted by the Soviet regime. 
When the Germans catch her reading a pamphlet and accuse her of being a partisan, 
she successfully dupes them into believing that she is sympathetic to the Nazis. 
Using her physical attractions and plying the German officers with drink, she steals 
secret documents. When she realizes that the Germans no longer trust her and that 
she cannot escape, she grabs a gun and shoots a German officer before being shot 
through the hand and subdued. She is then tortured and executed, dripping blood all 
the way to her execution site.182 
Zoia .Baiger. Kruglova of Ostrov, a scout who passed as a German‘s 
mistress, learned how to shoot and played war games before the war. During the 
war, she helps build fortifications and serves as a nurse. She eventually becomes a 
reconnaissance scout, and leads a double life, crossing back and forth over enemy 
lines. Some Russians scorn her, believing her to be a German prostitute, but she 
gains the trust of Germans and the right to travel freely and gather intelligence that 
leads to the bombing of a German airfield. Eventually, she is captured, beaten, and 
transferred to a death camp, from which she escapes and returns to Ostrov, only to be 
captured, interrogated, beaten, and executed.183 Tatiana Bauer Klimantovich, a half-

Hungarian, half-Russian partisan scout in the Minsk region, and Ina Konstantinova, a 
partisan scout from the Moscow region, and Liuba Shevtsova, from the Krasnodon 
.Young Guard. underground movement all cunningly manipulate Nazi occupiers 
and acquire valuable information or supplies. 
With the exception of Liuba Shevtsova, these historical .rogues. were 
virtually unknown until the Thaw period, well after the death of Stalin. Perhaps their 
independent thinking or their vacillation between roles initially made them suspect. I 
include them in this category because they have most of the same characteristics and 
fit into the same storyline as the typical warrior-martyr. As with the warrior-martyr, 
narrators treat the reader to graphic descriptions of brutal treatment of their bodies. 
They, too, are immortalized in visual and verbal monuments. 
This typology of the warrior-martyr forms a picture of an ideal Soviet young 
woman, a representative of the brave, aggressive Soviet people. The warrior-martyr 
is a version of the socialist realist .positive hero.. She fits Katerina Clark‘s 
description of the positive hero as an .emblem of Bolshevik virtue, someone the 
reading public might be inspired to emulate..184 Like other Soviet positive heroes, 
the warrior-martyr embody the three pillars of socialist realism: party-mindedness 
(partiinost‘), national patriotism [narodnost.], characterized by spontaneity, and 
correct ideological thinking [ideinost.]. By embodying these three pillars, the 
warrior-martyr becomes a leader and is able to inspire the masses with her words. 
She is always smart; she knows when to speak, when to be silent, and when to listen. 
184 Clark, The Soviet Novel, 46. 

90 
She always chooses the precise words and can spontaneously give speeches in order 
to motivate people. She is energetic and life-loving, the embodiment of 1930s 
optimism. 
The lives of women warrior-martyrs typically conform to a master plot that 
can be divided into two parts. The first part leads up to the woman‘s capture, and 
comprises four major events or .plot functions. that point to her heroic potential: 
birth, childhood revelation of revolutionary leadership, initiation into Soviet society, 
and descent into the chaos of war, a period of duties and ordeals. Capture by the 
Nazis marks the beginning of the second part of the master plot. Four plot functions 
form this part: capture, torture and interrogation, execution, and achievement of 
immortality. 
Function 1: Birth into a Good Family 
Longer narratives usually detail the warrior-martyr‘s birth into a good, 
Soviet family. As a child she is raised by her parents and school to revere 
communism, Lenin, Stalin, and the Soviet state. Shura Lukovina-Gribkova, hanged 
after participating in a Volokolamsk underground organization, was born into an 
exemplary family in the Moscow region: her mother, a collective farm worker, had 
fought on the front lines in the Civil War, while her father was a factory worker.185 
When asked why she became a reconnaissance scout and radio operator, Klara 
Davidiuk mentions that although she wanted to serve the Soviet Union, she was 
185 ...... ........, .... ...... .. .... .........: ....... . ...... ........,. ....... 
.....: ........ . ........... (......: ......... ........, 1980), 5-36. 

91 
probably influenced by her father‘s example, as he had been a scout and then 
commissar of an armored train during the Civil War.186 
Function 2: Childhood Revelation of Leadership Potential 
In the heroine‘s childhood there comes a moment when it becomes clear that 
she understands the importance of the party on a deeper level than her peers and 
exhibits traits that indicate her future martyrdom. Liza Chaikina brings ideological 
.truth. to her family, politically re-educating her mother, convincing the older 
peasant woman to join the kolkhoz. Probably following Gor‘kii‘s and Ostrovskii‘s 
models, this revelation of revolutionary leadership occurs in part as a result of 
difficult circumstances which have .tempered. the future martyrs. Narrators 
describe the childhood as difficult. For example, the narrator of Margarita Aliger‘s 
...: ..... exaggerates the poverty of the Kosmodem‘ianskaia family and 
highlights the death of Zoia‘s father. These hardships strengthen the warriormartyr‘
s character. Regardless of challenges, the warrior-martyr becomes an 
ideological leader amongst her peers at school. 
Function 3: Initiation into the Collective and Coming of Age 
A proper upbringing prepares the warrior-martyr to assume responsibility as 
a Soviet citizen. Clark argues that the typical Soviet novel‘s plot suggests that the 
most appropriate analogy must be the tribal rite of passage or initiation, in which a 
186 .. ........., comp., .... ........... .......: .......... ...... . ..........., ..... 1 
(......: ............ ............ .........., 1987), 314. 

92 
young adult undergoes a series of trials and completes appropriate tasks. If 
successful, the young person becomes a full-fledged member of the society.187 The 
initiation as an adult into Soviet society for the future warrior-martyr takes typically 
two different forms. Sometimes this function takes the form of acceptance into 
Komsomol after an interview. In some works it occurs when the young woman 
goes to the recruiting office and demands to enlist. The woman warrior usually takes 
an oath at one of these two moments. She expresses her desire to submit to the will 
the collective. In Aliger‘s play, Zoia reads and meditates on the Komsomol pledge 
as a Christian would say a prayer: 
...... ....... ... ...., ..... ......, .. .. ..... ...... . ..... 
............: .... .......... ......... ....... ................ 
...... . .... ....... ...... .. ... ... .... ...., . .... 
...........—. ...... . .... ........... . .....…... 
.......…..... . ... . ...... ... ........., . .... ..... ... 
.........,—. .... ...........— .....…. ..... ............ 
(At the beginning, she read to herself and then louder, but not very loud and 
quite anxiously: to be wholeheartedly dedicated to the great socialist 
Motherland and to be ready to give all of one‘s strength for it—and if 
necessary, one‘s life. And if necessary—life...how strange...When I first read 
this, it took my breath right away--And, if necessary—life...And perhaps it 
really would become necessary.)188 
For Zoia, joining the Komsomol is tantamount to becoming a soldier; both must be 
willing to give their lives for the Motherland. Zoia‘s Komsomol interview comprises 
one of the key moments in Arnshtam‘s film, when Zoia, through her thoughtful 
responses, sets herself apart from her peers and shows her dedication to her country. 
187 Clark, The Soviet Novel, 167. 
188 ......, ...: ............ ............., 11. 

93 
When giving an oath during a recruitment interview or upon joining the war 
effort, the martyr states that she is willing to do anything to help the Motherland. 
She lacks all individuality, unlike the warrior-knight, who, as we will see, goes to the 
recruiting center as a trained pilot or a sniper. Ulia Gromova and Liuba Shevtsova, 
along with all of the other members of Molodaia Gvardiia, take the following oath 
when the young people form the underground organization: 
., ____, ....... . .... ...... ....... ......., ..... ..... ..... 
...... .. ......, ..... ..... ...... ................ ....., ..... 
..... ..... ...... ............ .......: .............. ......... 
..... ....... ............ ....... . ........... ..... ..., ... 
........ .... ...... . ....... ........ . ....... ...... 
.......... .. ........., .......... ...... . ...., .. ..... ..... 
....., .. ............ ...... ......-......... . .... ... .... 
..... ........... ... ....., . ..... .. ... ...... .......... .... 
.. . ...... ... ......... ...... ... ....... ... ..-.. ........, .. 
..... ... ..., ... ...... ..... ...... ........, . .... ...... 
........ ....... .... .... .......... ..... .. ....., ...... .. 
......! 
(I, _____, joining the ranks of the Young Guard, before my friends in arms, 
before my native long-suffering land, before all people, I solemnly swear: 
unquestioningly to fulfill any task of the organization; to keep in deep secret 
everything to do with work in the Young Guard. I swear to avenge 
relentlessly burnt, destroyed cities and villages, the blood of our people, the 
martyr‘s death of our heroic miners. And if this revenge requires my death, I 
will give it without a minute‘s hesitation. If I violate this sacred oath under 
torture or through cowardice, then let my name, my family forever be 
damned, and me myself be punished by the stern hand of my comrades. 
Blood for blood, death for death!)189 
This oath shows the sacrifice of the individual for the benefit of the collective and 
the willingness of the martyr to die for the Soviet cause. The last line, .Blood for 
blood, death for death!,. recalls Old Testament justice and reinforces the sanctity of 
189 ......, ....... ......., 2-3. 

94 
the oath. The peasant Ganna Bondarchuk pledges during her interview, ........ 
......, .... ....... . ....., ........ ......, . ...., . ...... ........ (I 
swear on my honor that if you accept me into the brigade and entrust me with a 
weapon, though I may die, I will fulfill your command.).190 
Often, the woman receives arms at this moment. This act of arming 
transforms the heroine into a warrior; she has successfully completed the first part of 
her initiation, as the elders, or military superiors, have deemed her sufficiently 
prepared and dedicated to join the collective. Although Liubov‘ Kosmodem‘ianskaia 
barely mentions Zoia‘s recruitment interview, she notes that Zoia receives a 
weapon.191 Ina writes home, .. .... ...... ......., ...., ... ........ (.I 
have a rifle now. I‘m like a grown-up.).192 The weapon transforms her into an 
adult, from a girl into a woman. 
Usually, a narrator uses the Komsomol or recruitment interview only as the 
beginning of the initiation. If one is described in great detail, then the other is often 
only implied in the narrative. The typical inclusion of only one of the two interviews 
suggests that the two events are alternates of one and the same function in the text. 
Both by becoming a Kosomol member and by joining the army, a person becomes a 
member of the collective and shows total dedication to the nation and a willingness 
to perform heroic deeds on its behalf. War-time posters, such as one honoring Zoia 
Kosmodem‘ianskaia‘s brother, Aleksander, a tankist and Hero of the Soviet Union,

192 ............., ....... .. ......, 112. 

95 
depicts a tank amidst ruins and a picture of Aleksandr in uniform and includes the 
words, .Hero and Komsomol member. (Geroi komsomolets), equating Komsomol 
membership with heroic deeds.193 
At the start of the war, Komsomol members immediately began contributing to the 
war effort. At the beginning of the war, recruiting offices only accepted men as 
soldiers. Zoia complains to her mother, .=........ .......,‘ ....... ... .... 
=.... . .....—.. ........ ....... .. ...... .... . .. ....., ... . 
........... .. ..... ....! .... ........ . ..... . . ........ ...... .. 
.......! .......: ..... ..... .........‘. (.=The boys are leaving,‘ she told 
me. =Where and why? They aren‘t saying. They don‘t take girls. If only you knew 
how I tried to convince them to take me! You know I can shoot. And I‘m strong. 
Nothing helped! They said: they are accepting only boys‘.).194 Soon thereafter, in 
fall 1941, presumably after realizing the value of women reconnaissance scouts, 
recruiters began accepting women like Zoia. Most women, however, were 
encouraged to serve as nurses, factory workers, or barricade builders. Often a young 
woman begins contributing to the war effort on the home front until something 
compels her to leave home. This event functions as a turning point and leads the 
woman to ask for mobilization as warrior. For instance, Ina Konstantinova joined 
the war effort after she learned of her boyfriend‘s death. Most often, the woman 
warrior-martyr joins the war effort because she knows she must, as a true Soviet

194 ..............., ....... .. ......, 156. 

96 
citizen who possesses all of the characteristics outlined above, because, as Zoia tells 
her mother in Arnshtam‘s film, she cannot do otherwise: her parents, school, and 
nation have prepared her. She cannot sit at home. Some women, like Vera 
Voloshina, had prepared themselves as warriors during militarization and want to 
serve precisely in combat, as a .warrior. (boets): ............ ...... . .... 
......... ... ........ . .... ......, ........ ...... ..... ....... 
....... ....... ... ........ .. ........, .........., ........ .......,. .. 
........ ..... ...... .......... (.War was imminent. Vera understood this very 
well and even wanted, wanted terribly to become a warrior. It was not in vain that 
she had learned how to shoot a rifle, revolver, machine gun .Maksim.. She had not 
learned to ride a motorcycle just by accident.).195 Rather than become a nurse, Vera 
Voloshina enlists as a partisan. 
Function 4: Descent into Chaos—Entering Combat 
After joining the war effort, the crucial transformation begins as the woman 
warrior-martyr, now a partisan, goes on missions. Katerina Clark notes that sacrifice 
is crucial to Stalinist novels as the major act in the process of coming of age. 
Sacrifice occurs when the character descends into chaos, receives instruction from 
teachers, undergoes an ordeal, and dies a grizzly death.196 During this period, the 
person being initiated receives instruction from elders; warrior-martyrs typically

97 
receive instruction from more experienced fighters or partisan cell leaders. In 
Aliger‘s play about Zoia, in the delirium she experiences after her torture, Zoia 
receives instruction from Stalin himself. 
As Clark puts it, this rite of passage of descent entails the .killing of oneself 
to give birth to the other..197 When the heroine descends into chaos, she must leave 
her former self behind in order to become a warrior. Clark notes that in the Soviet 
novel, .when the hero sheds his individualistic self at the moment of passage, he dies 
as an individual and is reborn as a function of the collective..198 In the case of the 
warrior-martyr, the heroine‘s body undergoes physical transformation, changing into 
the muscular body of the militarized woman. For example, just before leaving home, 
Arnshtam‘s Zoia cuts her hair. Sometimes, the warrior-martyr changes her 
traditional women‘s clothing for a uniform. After leaving home, the warrior-martyr 
often becomes leaner and more muscular, living in the forest, surviving with little 
food and no comfort. This physical transformation symbolizes the heroine‘s mental 
and spiritual tempering. The heroine is sometimes unrecognizable to her kinfolk, as 
is the case with the partisan, Mariia (Zoia) Poryvaeva, when she returns home on 
leave: ..........., ..........., ........... ......... ..... ....... ..... 
.. ...... .. ........ .. ...., .. ....—...-.. ..... ........... ..., 
........... ....., ........ . ...... .., .... ...... .. ...... .. .....

98 
up, became sterner. It was apparent that she had lived through and learned about 
things others did find out about in a lifetime.).199 This transformation or tempering 
of the hero is typical of socialist realist literature, in which the hero must suffer and 
transcend his suffering to become fully conscious.200 
The partisan typically lives in the forest and carries out orders, for example, 
going on reconnaissance missions, serving as a messenger, or participating in raids. 
If the warrior-martyr is working in the underground, rather than as a reconnaissance 
scout, such as Liza Chaikina, Ulia Gromova of Molodaia Gvardiia, or Anna 
Morozova, officially a laundress on a Nazi airbase and coordinator of the 
Seshchinskii underground organization, she may organize partisan activities or write 
propaganda leaflets. In short, the future warrior-martyr does whatever is needed to 
aid her comrades. She often assumes a leadership position. 
In her work as a partisan, the martyr-rogue assumes different identities and 
behaves in a manner that would seem anti-Soviet to the uninitiated around her. 
Other Russians misunderstand her and accuse her being a traitor. She understands 
her compatriots‘ feelings, but she so loves the Motherland that she is able to 
withstand the scorn of her Russian compatriots as well as revolting German sexual 
advances in order to perform her patriotic duty.

99 
Function 5: Capture 
Comparing Zoia Kosmodem‘ianskaia to Joan of Arc, Daniela Rathe argues 
that both women undergo two rites of passage: the transition of girl into warrior 
followed by the elevation of the warrior into a national hero, a martyr, and a saint. 
The first four functions of the warrior-martyr master plot comprise the transition 
from girl into warrior; in the last four functions, the woman warrior transforms into a 
warrior-martyr and national hero and enters the mythic realm as a Soviet saint. 
Although the woman warrior has performed dutifully before her capture, her true 
inner strength and devotion to the Motherland become apparent only after her 
capture. Her deeds in the second part are truly heroic. 
Sometimes narrators barely describe the warrior-martyr‘s capture. When 
they do describe the capture, the warrior-martyr is always one against many. For 
example, the circumstances of Liza Chaikina‘s capture differ from version to 
version, but her brave, calm demeanor remains constant throughout the versions. In 
Biriukov‘s novel, after a traitor has betrayed her, Nazis capture her in a village in the 
dead of night. Her captors attempt to lead her to a tank, in order to transport her to 
another village, but she shrugs them off and walks to the tank herself. In Zykov‘s 
play, an alcoholic traitor, Arishka, betrays Liza by telling the Germans where Liza is 
spending the night. The Nazis storm the hut and grab the defenseless, sleeping 
woman. She awakes and berates them.201 In Komissarova‘s narrative poem, Liza is 
sleeping peacefully, dreaming of her beloved, when the Germans burn the hut and 
201 .. ....., ............: ........... ....., . .... ......... (1956-7), ....., .. 2095, 
..... 8, ... ... 301, 63. 

100 
capture her as she leaves. In all three variants, the Nazis capture Liza only because 
they outnumber and overpower her, making it impossible for her to defend herself. 
All stories agree that she was captured, not as a result of some incompetence or 
carelessness on her part, but because of treachery. 
A traitor also betrays the members of the Young Guard. In Fadeev‘s novel, 
Liuba‘s and Ulia‘s arrests mirror different versions of Chaikina‘s arrest. Like 
Biriukov‘s Liza, Ulia approaches the Nazis herself. She knows that since she has 
been betrayed, there is no use in trying to escape. The German occupiers are simply 
stronger and more numerous than Molodaia Gvardiia. Like Zykov‘s Liza, Nazis 
capture Liuba while she is lying defenseless in bed, in a state of undress. 
In all of the Zoia stories Zoia‘s capture receives little attention, and for good 
reason. Archival sources indicate that in actuality, the Russian peasants of 
Petrishchevo, not wanting her to burn down their barns, turned her in to the Nazis.202 
Most versions note briefly that she was captured while attempting to burn down 
peasant huts and barns housing Nazis. For example, in Arnshtam‘s film, a Nazi 
soldier grabs her from behind and overpowers her as she is launching a kerosene 
torch toward a barn. She was captured because she had been preoccupied with 
fulfilling her mission. E. I. Chichaeva deviates from the canonical version by 
portraying Zoia‘s capture metaphorically: ......... .... ..... ........,/ ..... 
........, ...... ......../ ..... ....., ....... .... .... ...... (.A flock of 
wild kites flew up/ Wild kites, black crows./ They began to tear apart, to peck your 
202 Rathe, .Soja—eine =Sowjetische Jeanne d‘Arc‘?. 45-59. 

101 
white body.).203 In this version, Zoia, a small bird, is at a numerical and physical 
disadvantage. 
Function 6: Interrogation and Torture 
While narrators may not dwell on the warrior-martyr‘s capture, they spare no 
words describing her interrogation and torture. Here is her truly heroic moment. 
During interrogation, the woman warrior-martyr never divulges information that 
might be useful to Germans, hence the origin of the phrase ........, ... 
..........,. or .to remain stoically quiet, like a partisan.. She answers in a manner 
that only frustrates and infuriates Nazi officers. For example, when asked where 
partisans were, Liza replies, that they are everywhere the fascists are.204 In his onepage 
Pravda article, .Tania,. which began the Zoia and woman warrior-martyr 
myth, Petr Lidov includes explicit details of Zoia‘s interrogation: 
. 10 ..... .... ...... ........ ....... .. ... ..-...... .......

Russian.

.Tell us, where is Stalin?. 
.Stalin is at his post,. answered Tat‘iana.)205 
203 ......., ... ...... ... ....-......,. 4. 
204 ......., ....., 350. 
205 ....., .....,. 3. 

102 
In all versions of the Zoia myth, the Nazis abuse Zoia, as they attempt to force her to 
answer them, but she never admits anything. 
Authors spare no words detailing methods of Nazi torture of warrior-martyrs‘ 
bodies. Nazis beat Zoia, burn her with a kerosene lamp, and whip her with belts. 
They beat Liza, bend her hands back, break her fingers, and torture Liza‘s mother in 
front of her. Explicit references to rape and sexual assault are noticeably absent from 
all Soviet works about warrior-martyrs, but narrators often infer these crimes by 
describing how Nazi interrogators strip the warrior-martyrs. All accounts of Zoia 
Kosmodem‘ianskaia note that Nazis forced Zoia to walk barefoot from hut to hut in 
Petrishchevo in December, wearing nothing but her underclothes. Zoia‘s near 
nakedness and the fact that she was removed to private locations suggest 
euphemistically that she was raped by Nazis in at least one of the huts housing 
German officers. 
The heroine may be executed rather quickly after capture, as Zoia was, or she 
may be imprisoned for some time, as the Nazis attempt to wear her down in order to 
gain information. Fadeev describes the warrior-martyrs‘ last days in the Krasnodon 
prison: 
C ..... ... . ..... .........a........ . ...... .po...... ...

.p......... . ...y.... . ........ ...... c .. .y...e..... ...

............. .a.y.. . ........ 

103 
(From that watershed day in the prison life of the .Young Guard,. they 
stopped hiding their membership in the organization and entered into an open 
battle with their tormenters. They were rude to them, mocking them, and 
sang revolutionary songs in their cells, danced, and made scenes when 
someone was dragged out of his or her cell for interrogation. 
And the torture, to which they were now subjected, was torture 
unimaginable to the human consciousness, unthinkable from the point of 
view of human reason and conscience).206 
By this point in the novel, the members have already proven their unwavering love 
for their country and the Nazis can do nothing to make them deny their faith. One 
can find more evidence of an informal canonization of warrior-martyrs in the 
transformation of personal effects into relics. These relics often bear testament to the 
martyr‘s last torments. For example, sometimes the imprisoned warrior-martyr 
manages to send a note to her from prison. The rogue-martyr Liuba writes her 
mother: ......., ...., .... .... .... ...... . ..... ...... (.Goodbye, 
Mama, your daughter Liuba is going into the damp earth.).207 These notes become a 
final testament of the martyr‘s last moments and suffering; they usually end up in a 
museum, with other .relics,. relating to the martyr‘s life. Zoia (Baiger) Kruglova‘s 
last letter home, written in blood, not only becomes a relic in a museum, but was 
distributed to Soviet soldiers who carried her letter and were inspired by reading it. 
From her prison cell, Kruglova writes, 
... ........., . ..... ... ...... .. ....., ...., ..... ..., 
... ..... ....... ........ ...... .... ...., ..... ....... ..., 
...... ...... . ......... .. ..... ....., ......., ... .... ..... 
.., ....., ..... ... ......, .. ....... . ......... ..

207 Ibid.,2-273. 

104 
(I await the firing squad. I‘m not thinking about life anymore, even 
though, my dear ones, I really want to live a bit longer to see you, hug you 
warmly, and sob out all my grief on your shoulder, Mama. 
But this is my fate, at which I am by no means offended. I have done 
my duty. My dear ones, take pride that I have sullied neither your name nor 
my honor. I die, and I know for what.)208 
Kruglova‘s last letter emphasizes that she died for a purpose, just as her readers may 
die in battle. Even after inconceivable physical suffering, she is fiercely loyal to her 
country and proud of her name. Such gruesome physical evidence shows that 
brutality and imprisonment have no effect on the warrior-martyr. Her mind and her 
will are stronger than her body. She will bite through her lip before she betrays her 
nation. She gives proof of her inner strength and love for the Motherland, for the 
Russian people, and for the Soviet state during the interrogation function. 
Function 7: Execution 
Definitions of martyrdom often include aspects of .witnessing. or confessing 
of one‘s faith in the martyr‘s final actions. As the Greek noun martyros means 
.witness,. bearing witness to one‘s convictions is a central aspect of a martyr‘s 
death.209 The woman warrior-martyr usually demonstrates her faith by dying a 
public death before many witnesses. During this public execution, she proclaims 
moving last words meant to motivate the Soviet people, not merely those who fight 
in World War II, but those who will continue the epic battle for the Communist 
cause.

105 
By staying true to her country and people, by upholding her Communist faith, 
the warrior-martyr shows that although the Nazis could do anything they wanted to 
her body, they had no control over her mind and soul. Masolov writes about Mariia 
.Zoia. Poryvaeva, a martyr-rogue who was executed in August, 1942: 
... ............ ......, . ........ ......, ....... .... .........

(Rushing forward, with a burning gaze, the young woman was beautiful in 
her last effort. Tormented by torture, her hands, twisted by the barbed wire, 
the Soviet patriot was stronger than her enemies. Krezer could not bear it. 
Taking his Browning from his pocket, he fired two times into Poryvaeva‘s 
chest.) 
The image of the physically powerless, yet morally and spiritually powerful young 
woman, outnumbered by Nazis, persists throughout her capture, interrogation and 
torture, and execution. 
In some narratives, Nazis force warrior-martyrs to march to their execution 
site, recalling Christ‘s march to Golgotha. Vera Voloshina reportedly dripped blood 
as she was led to her execution.211 Up until this moment, the martyr has been 
publicly silent, defiantly refusing to answer interrogators‘ questions, ......., ...

or already on the scaffolding, the warrior-martyr staves off physical death one last

march, as do Ulia and other members of the Young Guard: .......... ........ 
......., . ..... .. ... .........…. (.The severe avenger will rise up, and he 
will make us stronger.).212 Mariia Poryvaeva sings a pioneer song, ... ... ... 
...... ........, .. ...... ........ . ..... (.We walked under the thunder of 
cannonades, we looked death in the face.). 213 
Sometimes, the martyr will address the crowd one last time from the 
execution site. Although the reality of such a situation is doubtful (what Nazi would 
simply stand by and let the condemned proclaim inflammatory words?), the final 
speech is a key moment in the warrior-martyr‘s tale. She stands above, looking 
down at her Nazi executioners and her compatriots. Although the warrior-martyr 
often addresses the Germans, her inspiring final words are intended for her Russian 
audience. In Biriukov‘s novel, Liza Chaikina addresses .......!….....!. (.My 
dear ones! My people!.) and then proclaims ..... ....... .....!.; .......... 
.. ..... ......!.; and ..... ......!…........ ........!. (.The Red Army 
is coming!.; .Help it will all your strength!.; and .Victory is coming!...Farewell 
comrades!.).214 The martyr addresses not only her audience but the future 
generations who take inspiration from her sacrifice. 
Undeniably, Zoia Kosmodem‘ianskaia‘s execution inspired writers, artists, 
and filmmakers to an extent greater than the final moments of other warrior-martyrs.

them!…I am not afraid to die, comrades! To die for one‘s people is 
happiness…You will hang me in a little while, but I am not alone. There are 
two hundred million of us, and you can‘t hang us all. They will avenge 
me…Farewell, comrades! Fight on, have no fear! Stalin is with us! Stalin 
will come!.)216 
These words immediately became a crucial part of the official Zoia myth, and were 
reproduced in many works about Zoia. During the war, versions often included 
reference to Stalin, as we find in Chichaeva‘s novina:

(Farewell, my dear comrades,

Our enemies will not overcome our knights‘ strength.)217 
In her eight-line speech, Chichaeva includes Zoia‘s farewell to her comrades, and a 
plea to avenge her death. She encourages them not to fear torture or death, but to 
love the fatherland, for the people, for the country, for Stalin. Arnshtam‘s film 
concludes with Zoia‘s beautiful face, with a church in the background, urging 
Russians to fight Germans. The church reminds the Russian people of their 
Orthodox roots and recalls Christ‘s martyrdom, drawing the obvious parallel 
between Zoia and Christ, Soviet and Christian sanctification. 
Function 8: Immortality 
In the last function of the master plot, the woman warrior-martyr achieves 
immortality through the memories of the Soviet citizenry and future successes of the 
Soviet state. Initially, during the war, she inspires others to avenge her death, as was 
the case with Zoia. It is worth repeating that during the war, Soviets cut out her 
picture, honored her memory, and vowed revenge for her death. 
After the war, she becomes a leader-by-example for future generations. They 
carry on her memory by devoting their lives to building communism. Zykov‘s play 
concludes with Liza Chaikina‘s beloved, Fedia, carrying her lifeless body off the 
stage, saying ... ....., ......! ..........., ......!. (.For Chaika, forward! 
Komsomol members, forward!.).218 The message to the audience is clear.

The Soviets imprinted the warrior-martyr in public memory by building 
monuments at her execution site, school, and home. They celebrated her in art, 
music, film, and fiction. They named streets and pioneer circles after her. In martyr 
narratives, they preserve relics in museums under glass cases (figures 15, 16, and 
17). Documentary narratives include pictures of the martyr‘s Komsomol card, 
letters, and other physical objects related to her. 
Through collective memory and through the successes of the Soviet Union, 
the masses resurrect the deceased warrior: ... ....... .. ....... ..... ... 
..... .... ...... . .... . ..... . ......, . ..... ........ . ......., . 
..... ...... . ....... (.We will never forget Masha. She will live together 
with us at work and in our struggles, in our joys and our successes, in our memories 
and our songs.).219 Through memory she achieves immortality: .. ... ...

is ever lost. Heroes do not die—not only because our memory of them is eternal but 
because they live in ourselves: in our affairs, in our deeds and thoughts. Ina found 
immortality in thousands of thousands of lives.).220 The warrior-martyr leaves her 
mark on collective memory in a way that other women warriors do not. Katerina 
Clark notes that in the socialist realist novel, when the hero dies a ritual death,

110 
history‘s onward march does not stop. Rather, other heroes survive to carry on the 
cause of ideological truth and continue the struggle for communism. The hero‘s 
spirit lives on well after death.221 
Zoia Kosmodem‘ianskaia remains the most famous and beloved Soviet 
woman to have participated in World War II. Although other warrior martyrs, 
namely Liza Chaikina, Ukia Gromova, and Liubov‘ Shevtsova, are recognizable to 
Russians, none have achieved the nationwide, cult-like devotion of Zoia. Now that I 
have characterized the martyr and her plot, I will now discuss the process of 
mythmaking by focusing on Zoia, since she is the most famous example. This part 
of the dissertation examines how this story became a tremendously powerful myth 
that told Russians who they were at a time when their land and their lives were under 
mortal threat. In the shaping of the Zoia myth, one finds a conflict of public 
spontaneity and state control, as the public responded overwhelmingly to Zoia‘s 
death as a nation, and the state grabbed control to shape the narrative to conform to 
ideological goals. 
Before we examine the process of state mythologization, it will be well to 
summarize the facts, as we know them. Zoi Kosmodem‘ianskaia was an 18-year-old, 
Muscovite schoolgirl and Komsomol member, hanged by Nazis on November 29, 
1941 for allegedly burning houses and stables in Petrishchevo, a village near 
Moscow. In February 1942, she became the first woman in World War II to be 
named Hero of the Soviet Union. By her actions alone, Zoia Kosmodemian‘skaia 
221 Clark, The Soviet Novel, 181. 

111 
did not contribute much to the Soviet war effort: she was an inexperienced, 
comparatively unskilled scout in a special forces unit, killed within weeks of 
volunteering for duty. According to the official narrative, the Germans captured her 
in the act of burning a stable. 
During the 2005-2006 academic year, while in Moscow researching woman 
warriors, I asked twenty Russians to tell me about women who participated in World 
War II. Almost always, Zoia Kosmodemian‘skaia would be the first woman 
mentioned. To this day, most Russians remember, respect, and love Zoia. The 
corpus of works about Zoia far surpasses that about other woman warriors.222 Her 
schools were transformed into museums. Schools, pioneer troops, streets, ships, and 
an asteroid were named after her (figure 18).223 Upon entrance to the Moscow metro 
station, Partizanskaia, one encounters a large sculpture of Zoia.224 Physical 
manifestations of Zoia‘s legacy are seemingly endless. Across the years, after the 
collapse of the Soviet Union, she remains an icon, honored and remembered by 
Russians. How and why was this insignificant girl transformed into such a widely 
admired legendary figure, much greater than her actual deeds? 
222 Works include one narrative poem, two plays, two films, one documentary, ten biographical 
sketches, three novellas, five documentary novels, her mother‘s memoirs, two paintings, five public 
sculptures, a ballet, a song, lyric poems, a novina, a Bulgarian dissertation (about Aliger‘s poem 
.Zoia.) and possibly a propaganda poster. Some of her letters have been published, and Zoia‘s 
mother, Liubov Kosmodemianskaia, included excerpts of Zoia‘s diaries in her memoir .Tale of Zoia 
and Shura,. which was printed about 3.5 million times (Kazimiera J. Cottam, Women in Air and 
Resistance (Nepean, Canada: New Military Publishing:, 1998), 299). The Soviet Post Office issued a 
commemorative stamped envelope with Zoia‘s portrait in 1985 (Cottam, Women in Air and 
Resistance, 299).

112 
The Zoia myth, like other famous partisan myths, began with reportage. It 
sprang from the difficult days of early 1942, the first winter of the Nazi invasion. It 
developed throughout the Soviet era, and persists, albeit in increasingly fragmented 
forms, into the post-Soviet period. Through Lidov‘s 1942 articles in Pravda, which 
outraged and traumatized the public, Zoia‘s torture and death became central to the 
myth.225 In the first article (January 27, 1942), a picture of the young partisan‘s 
mutilated body drew attention to her suffering (figure 19). Nothing in her biography 
mattered, except that she was a martyr. Lidov begins his article by letting the reader 
know that a partisan, who called herself Tat‘iana, had been executed by the 
Germans. He then moves on to describe the danger in which Moscow had been, 
highlighting the significance of Tat‘iana‘s partisan activity. Lidov answers any 
questions readers might have about how Zoia was captured by reporting that 
residents of Petrishchevo had learned of her capture from German soldiers‘ stories. 
He describes .Tat‘iana‘s. last actions using male pronouns so that the reader is 
surprised, just as Nazi soldiers would be in Arnshtam‘s 1944 film, when they 
discover that the stable-burning, communication-line-cutting partisan they had 
captured was in actuality, a young woman. He mentions that .Tat‘iana. was armed. 
After those few paragraphs, Lidov progresses to a detailed description of Zoia‘s 
torture and interrogation, focusing on her resolute silence regardless of beatings: 
........ ......... ...... ......, .. ....... .. ...... .. ...... ...... A

about Zoia‘s execution when spending the night in Pushkin with other war correspondents. 
......... ........ and ........ ........-..........., ... ...............: ...... . 
....... (......: ..., 2005). 

113 
..... ..... ........: =...,‘ =.. .....,‘ ...... ..... .. ...... ....., ... 
....... (.The host counted two hundred blows, but Tat‘iana did not make one 
sound, but again she answered =no,‘ =I won‘t say,‘ only her voice was deeper than 
before.).226 He emphasizes her self-discipline by describing her lips, bitten through 
as she forced herself to remain quiet. He describes physical evidence (bruises, 
abrasions) conveyed by witnesses and describes her state of undress and her bound 
arms. He notes that she was beaten frequently into the early morning and details 
various methods of torture that would eventually inspire artists. On the day of her 
execution, the soldiers divide her clothing and field bag amongst themselves, just as 
Roman soldiers divided up Christ‘s garments.227 Lidov juxtaposes 
Kosmodem‘ianskaia‘s silence before tormenters with last words to her people. His 
specific details about her last moments, such as the fact that a peasant Praskovia 
Kulik wailed as she was hanging, strengthen the apparent validity of his article. By 
including such seemingly insignificant details, it seems as though Lidov is reporting 
every known detail about Kosmodem‘ianskaia‘s execution. After describing the 
torture, execution, and postmortem mutilation of her body, Lidov begins the 
sanctification of the partisan uses religious words: .martyr‘s death.228 
(muchenicheskaia smert‘). He also redefines .heroine. (geroinia) and ..... 
........ ......, ........ ...... . ....... .. ........ (.the daughter of a 
great people whom none will ever break or bend.), using the words that had been

applied to the last Heroes of the Soviet Union, the crew of the Rodina.229 Finally, 
Lidov predicts the future cult of Zoia: citizens will stop by her grave to remember 
and thank her and will honor the parents and teachers that raised her. She will be 
glorified throughout the land. Most importantly: ....... ........ ...... . 
......... ..... ...... ....... (.Stalin will visit his faithful daughter in his 
thoughts.).230 Lidov‘s article about Zoia officially changed the expectations of 
women in the .Great Family. and the definition of a heroine. As Nina Tumarkin 
writes, .death was the perfect conclusion to a heroic feat, because it allowed the hero 
to sacrifice to the Motherland the most valuable thing in his possession, his life..231 
S. Strunnikov‘s .photograph. of Zoia‘s mutilated body accompanies Lidov‘s 
article, illustrating both the inhumane cruelty of the Nazi executioners, as well as the 
unknown partisan‘s immortal spirit, evident in the corpse‘s beautiful face.232 The 
dead woman‘s peaceful expression gives evidence of Zoia‘s last words about the 
happiness of dying for one‘s country and people. Rosalinde Sartorti compares this 
photograph to hagiographic depictions.233 
Supposedly, after reading about Tania, Liubov Kosmodemian‘skaia 
concluded that .Tania. was her daughter, and she identified the body. Zoia‘s

232 Poster artist Viktor Deni likely used the photograph as inspiration of his 1942 .Kill the Fascist- 
Monster. (..... .......-.......!.), which poster pictures a hanged women and mirrors the first 
pictures of Zoia that appeared in Pravda. The woman lies in the same position as Zoia, with the rope 
still around her neck, and her body has been mutilated in the same manner, with a missing left breast.

115 
identity was then released to the public. Zoia was named a Hero of the Soviet 
Union, and Pravda published the portrait that would become an icon (figure 20). 
The February 17 portrait that Pravda printed contributes to the dual response that the 
Soviet readers have to her image. The portrait shows a teenaged schoolgirl with a 
short, masculine haircut and a serious demeanor. She is both a .young woman. 
(devushka) as well as a serious, strong, militarized woman on pages 8-9 of the 3rd 
issue in 1942 of Rabotnitsa. Early in the creation of the myth, writers and artists 
were unsure how to portray Zoia. Their confusion often resulted in contradictory 
depictions of .Zoia the girl. and .Zoia the warrior.. 
Liubov‘ Kosmodem‘ianskaia addressed the Soviet nation on the radio, 
expressing her grief and appealing to the Soviet youth to avenge her brave, purehearted 
daughter.234 Her speech stoked the flames of people‘s devotion to her 
daughter. Several lieutenants on the northwestern front wrote Liubov‘ 
Kosomdem‘ianskaia, .We really should have some sleep but we cannot, for we have 
read your speech addressed to us, young Red Army men. Never before have we read 
anything with such passion and fervor..235 The media blitz continued as newspapers 
and journals reprinted Lidov‘s articles and occasionally decorated her portrait with 
laurels. Like Pravda, the women‘s journal Rabotnitsa placed its first article about 
Zoia toward the back, indicating that few responsible for official propaganda 
understood the impact of her story. However, after the public reaction to Zoia‘s

death, editors adorned the March 1942 issue 5, the first issue after the release of her 
identity, with Zoia‘s portrait. This cover was followed by a reprint of Liubov‘ 
Kosmodemian‘skaia‘s radio address. 
Although the partisan-martyr‘s beautiful face shows that her spirit transcends 
death, Petr Lidov‘s description of .Tania‘s. suffering and the image of the mutilation 
prompted spontaneous public outrage. People wrote letters to editors and to Liubov‘ 
Kosmodem‘ianskaia. The nation responded immediately to the Pravda article with 
an unprecedented outpouring of grief. Zoia‘s death came to represent all of the 
suffering the Russian people had lived through in the first months of war. As the 
Soviet public read about Zoia, they were moved to tears, moved publicly to lament 
her death and the loss of multitudes of fellow citizens. Embracing her image, they 
bonded with one other. 
Russians have an ancient tradition of lamenting the dead that includes family 
members and even professional wailers, hired for the funerals. Russians expected a 
young woman to have mastered the art of lamenting, just as she had mastered the arts 
of cooking and spinning.236 However, Merridale writes that .Red. funerals, 
beginning with Nekrasov‘s funeral in 1877, had no place for lamentation. Red 
funeral rituals included formality, red draped coffins, solemn speeches, processions, 
revolutionary hymns, and a sense that one was dying for freedom. Some saw 
mourning as self-indulgent, and one of the revolutionaries‘ favorite hymn was .Do 
236 Merridale, Night of Stone, 41. 

117 
not Weep..237 Authors of biographies of Zoia describe spontaneous public reactions 
and the beginning of the sanctification of Zoia as the myth unfolded. Marina 
Raskova, one of the three first female Heroes of the Soviet Union, the woman who 
would establish three women‘s air regiments, cut out Zoia‘s portrait and placed the 
picture on her desk. Raskova‘s mother writes: .. ......... ..... . . ........ 
........ ....... . .. ..... . ....... ... ....... .......... .. ....... 
....... ... ................ (.Upset, I went into Marina‘s room. I went up to 
her table and saw a portrait of Zoia Kosmodem‘ianskaia, cut out from the magazine 
and placed under glass.).238 The Young Guard‘s Oleg Koshevoi cried when he read 
about Zoia, cut out her picture, framed it and placed it above his bed.239 His mother 
writes ....... ... ....... ....., ......., . ..... ....... ... .. .. ........ 
....... ..... ......., . ........ . ... ...... (.This article struck Oleg, it 
seems, in the very heart. Even though he tried to cover his eyes with the newspaper, 
I noticed tears in them.).240 Zoia became one of the two principle examples for 
Oleg.241 
The Soviet public saw the pictures, heard the story about the young patriot, 
and were moved to action—to fight harder in battle, work longer hours at a factory, 
or write about her. In her memoir, Swallows Over the Front (........ ... 
......., 1984), pilot and Hero of the Soviet Union Marina Chechneva recalls how

Party official Mariia Runt read Lidov‘s article at the first political meeting of the 
women‘s aviation regiment:

(One remembers one of the first political meetings in the regiment. Mariia 
read aloud the vignette by P. Lidov .Tania,. about Zoia Kosmodem‘ianskaia. 
We listened, holding our breath, and crying, not hiding our tears. And Mariia 
cried. There were no prepared discussions, no speeches. And there did not 
need to be any. Deeply reliving the fate of an unknown girl, now so dear to 
us, we ourselves drew closer to each other, understanding what the support 
our friendship would give us.)242 
Reading Lidov‘s story of Zoia‘s death, the pilots bonded. Their experience is not 
unlike a religious experience in which a community of believers gathers before a 
higher power. 
All of the individual, incomprehensible losses and experiences of the first 
half year of the war converge in the image of Zoia, a model Soviet daughter. 
Russians were free to shed tears over her death, for mourning Zoia was a patriotic 
action. Apart from official literary documents and radio addresses including 
references to the nation in their framing of the Zoia story, and despite the state‘s 
immediate shaping of the story and its reception, the public freely and, seemingly,

Chichaeva‘s novina shows the unified nation mourning, and also gives evidence of 
the role the media played in publicizing Zoia‘s death. A Ukrainian poem shows that 
Zoia Kosmodem‘ianskaia‘s influence extended beyond the Russia. Nadezhda 
Belinovich writes:

Even Ukrainians mourned her death, glorified her memory, and were moved to 
avenge. As a result of collectivization and forced annexation prior to the war, 
Ukrainians were less loyal to the Soviet cause and most likely to desert the Red 
Army.246 The unifying factor of the Zoia myth in non-Russian lands cannot be 
underestimated. 
Zoia gave soldiers a reason for which to fight. Although they were all 
supposed to be fighting for Stalin, communism, and the Motherland, in reality, many 
were not so dedicated the .great leader.. These soldiers began to fight in earnest 
when they learned of Nazi cruelty. They could take the image of Zoia, both a brave 
warrior against fascism and a victim of it, onto the battlefield. According to her 
official biography, Mariia Oktiabrskaia, a tank operator and another Hero of the 
Soviet Union, was only too happy to fight in a tank battle after a commander 
informed her battalion that they were fighting the Nazi division responsible for 
Zoia‘s death. ........., ...... ... ..... ....... .......... .......,

Kosmodem‘ianskaia!.).247 Soviets carried her image with them into battle, if not 
physically, than mentally, as they used to carry icons with them during the tsarist 
regime. The lieutenants on the northwestern front wrote to Liubov‘ 
Kosmodem‘ianskaia of Zoia‘s unifying effect: .Today your speech has forced tears 
of wrathful indignation from our eyes. We dried them and solemnly took the 
following oath: never shall we forget .Tanya. and never shall we forgive the 
Germans her death. Her sacred image enraptures, sets afire, calls and leads us into 
the fray. ... In the moments of danger our men say .Tanya,. and .Tanya‘s. spirit 
lends them strength and courage. Now for us the name of .Tanya. is the 
embodiment of patriotism..248 The description of a girl‘s mutilated body likely 
inspired a primal urge to avenge her and protect other women from the same brutal 
death. 
Since the image of Zoia prompted the Soviet citizenry to fight harder in the 
battle against fascism, the state immediately started to proliferate images and 
writings that expanded Lidov‘s short article. Literary and visual works were 
contracted to build up her legend. Famous writers and artists developed stories about 
her: Margarita Aliger, Lev Arnshtam, Matvei Manizer, the Kukryniksy, and Dmitrii 
Shostakovich. The following table shows the main works about Zoia:

The works in this table show both the orchestrated shaping of the myth and 
spontaneous responses to it. Some of the most famous creative minds produced 
works that would become part of the national Zoia canon. Alongside them, 
especially early on, one finds works by unknown citizens, sometimes unnamed, 
appearing in presses all over the Soviet Union, responding to the people‘s need for 
more information about Zoia, showing her cult even amongst non-Russian ethnic 
groups. 
The early works about Zoia create a contradictory composite of her, as artists 
and writers did not yet know how to portray this national hero. Some depictions 
clearly follow precedents set in the 1930s, showing this .heroic daughter. as a 
strong, armed woman, while others emphasize her youth and her brutalized body. 
For example, in 1942, the sculptor Matvei Manizer created the first official 
monument to Zoia (figure 21). Continuing in the tradition of the 1930s militarized 
woman, he shows her strength and determined, purposeful carriage. Even though 
none of the official literary works or historical vignettes show that she fired a gun at 
anyone, he emphasizes her role as a warrior with a rifle over her shoulder. Manizer‘s 
Zoia embodies authority and purposefulness. She holds the rifle with her right arm, 
looks to the left, and steps forward with the right foot. Her left fist is clenched. Its 
muscular definition makes Zoia‘s body appear hard and almost indestructible. 

125 
Manizer‘s sculpture is likely the strongest, even most masculine depiction of the 
martyr. 
One version of Manizer‘s sculpture stands in Park Pobedy in Moscow. The 
statue also stands at the Partizanskaia (formerly, Izmailovskii Park) metro station in 
Moscow (figure 22). This sculpture closely resembles Manizer‘s original model, 
with the exception that this sculpture stands flush against a wall, rather than striding 
forward. Although the sculpture is tall, lean, and muscular, with a mostly boyish 
body, and short hair, Manizer ensures that her gender is clear, clothing her in a skirt 
and sculpting her with an open jacket in order to display her left breast. The breast 
would have reminded citizens of her martyrdom by recalling the cut-off left breast in 
Strunnikov‘s photograph. 
The drawing and painting by the artist collective Kukryniksy also focuses on 
Zoia‘s steadfast determination and strength before the Nazis and portrays a 
masculinized version of the heroine. The drawing, .The Interrogation of Zoia 
Kosmodem‘ianskaia. (....... ... ................), shows Zoia bound by her 
captors. She is roughly the same height as the Nazis, wears men‘s clothing, and looks 
like a boy. The drawing highlights her boldness, as she looks her main interrogator 
in the face. She does not flinch as one of Germans holds a candle up to her face. 
This candle illuminates her, while the rest of the figures in the drawing are 
animalistic and dark. The viewer can read her unwillingness to surrender or give up 
information to the Nazis. In their painting of her last moments, .Tania: The Victory 
of Zoia Kosmodem'ianskaia. (.....: ...... ... ................), Zoia stands 

126 
up straight and proud, despite a night of torture, and addresses the crowd, displaying 
a refusal to bow to her tormentors. 
Margarita Aliger departs from the 1930s depictions of armed heroism in her 
narrative poem .Zoia. written in Moscow between July and September. Aliger‘s 
poem was the most widely disseminated Zoia work of those published in 1942. 
Aliger read this poem over Soviet radio in 1942249 and in 1943, the poem was 
awarded the Stalin prize second degree.250 Aliger‘s .Zoia. reverts back to traditional 
gender roles: this Zoia is girlish and romantic, victimized by Nazi beasts. Her poem 
was likely meant to immortalize Zoia, bring tears, and inspire people to unite and 
carry about Liubov‘ Kosmodemian‘skaia‘s radio appeal to avenge her daughter‘s 
death. Aliger‘s poem, like all of the Zoia works, includes Zoia‘s moving last words. 
Foregrounding this speech at the execution certainly made it a key moment in the 
master plot of the warrior-martyr. Zoia orders the Soviet people: ......... .., 
......., .....…/. ...., .. ...... .......!/ ......!. (.Kill them, destroy 
them, burn.../ I will die, but Truth will prevail!/ Motherland!.).251 In the epilogue, 
the narrator writes, ..... .. ..... ......., ......../ . .......... .. 
.......: '. ...!‘. (.Now we can think, talk,/ and rise up to the command .to 
battle!.) 252 and ... .. .. ...... .... ......., . ...-.... .. ......... 
....... (.but we cannot sit at home, and all the same, we will gather together.). 253

The message to the reader is unmistakable: after hearing this poem, knowing about 
Zoia and her fate, one has to join the fight. If Zoia, a schoolgirl, fought for her 
country, then how can an older or stronger Soviet citizen do less for the war effort? 
Aliger‘s narrator plays upon her audience‘s emotions by portraying Zoia as a 
child throughout the poem. She introduces Zoia as a seventeen-year-old schoolgirl 
reading a book. Several times, Zoia is described as .girl. (devchonka). Her lips are 
.childlike. (detskie) lips.254 She has a maiden‘s body (devich.e telo).255 The torture 
and execution of such an innocent being seems all the more cruel in light of her 
youth and childlike vulnerability. Nevertheless, although her youth makes her story 
more moving, one cannot think that Zoia did not know for what she died. Aliger‘s 
emphasis on her reading shows that she was a thinking person and politically 
conscious, even at an early age. 
Aliger‘s Zoia possesses all of the characteristics common to the warrior 
woman martyr type; early Zoia works established the type. Aliger emphasizes her 
selflessness and desire to help others. As Zoia prepares for her fatal mission, we see 
her in the dark, cold forest. She thinks of those suffering all over her country: a 
dying soldier, a sighing mother, a young widow embracing an orphan, the city of 
Leningrad. .........., .........!? . .... ......! ....... ...! . ..... 
..., ... ......... (.Leningrad, Leningrad! I will help you! Give me orders! I 
will do all that is commanded.).256 She dies in order to alleviate suffering, hasten 
254 Ibid., 158. 
255 Ibid., 170. 
256 Ibid., 151. 

128 
the liberation of Motherland, and bring the return to a peaceful life. She dies in order 
to lead children on the path toward victory and to a life without fascism.257 
Moscow plays a larger role than the Motherland, probably because Aliger 
wrote it so shortly after the battle for Moscow. In the introduction and first chapter, 
Moscow is almost as important as Zoia. It acts like a mother, nurturing Zoia, until 
Zoia, becomes a warrior in order to defend her.258 Zoia joins the war effort after she 
watches barricades spring up in Moscow alleys and when Moscow is surrounded.259 
Later, in the midnight darkness of the forest, before her fatal mission, Zoia 
remembers the Timiriazevskii region in which she grew up.260 This poem is one of 
the only works that portrays Zoia solely as a Muscovite, without tying her to the 
Russian countryside through her family‘s dacha or her love for nature. 
Unlike later incarnations of the Zoia myth, Aliger‘s Zoia was written in the 
midst of the Stalin cult. As a result, she dies not only for the Soviet Motherland, 
people, and Moscow, but also for Stalin and for .Pravda,. or ideological truth, all of 
which appear as allegorical characters in Aliger‘s work. Several of the Zoia works 
written during the war feature Stalin; Aliger includes his encouraging words about 
victory.261 The spiritual father is with his children, including Zoia. Later, at her 
execution, when asked where her Stalin is, Zoia responds that he is .at his post. (na

129 
postu).262 He is with his people at home, at the factory, on the battlefield, and with 
Zoia at her execution. 
Aliger describes her poem as an attempt to unify the nation. She claims that 
she wrote the poem so that the readers would .choke along with Zoia. and so that 
Zoia could begin to breathe. .... ........ ........ . .../ ..., .... ........... 
...... . .... ... ........ ........ ... ...,/ ..... ... ...... ......!.263 
She wrote it to memorialize Zoia so that the Soviet nation would share Liubov‘s 
pain, so children follow Zoia on their path toward victory, and, primarily, so that the 
people would come together and remember the sacrifice of one perfect Soviet girl. 
Aliger‘s narrative poem transforms the androgynous Zoia of Manizer‘s and 
the Kukryniski‘s visual representations into a traditionally feminine .girl.. Two 
1944 works about Zoia continue this re-feminizing shaping of Zoia‘s body. E. I. 
Chichaeva follows Aliger‘s example and also emphasizes Zoia‘s girlish femininity. 
In .We Will Never-Ever Forget You: In Memory of Hero of the Soviet Union Zoia 
Kosmodem‘ianskaia. (... ...... ... ....-......: ....... ...... ..... 
.......... ..... .. .. ...............,. .recorded. in 1942, published in 
1944), Chichaeva uses the allegory of a bird that leaves its home and is killed. The 
small, kind, patriotic, right-minded, little bird flies faraway from her native Moscow 
to help her country and Stalin, only to be overcome by vicious predators:

(You, fast-winged, little dove 
You flew little bird 
Across the mountains, across the valleys 
Across the dark taiga, 
Across the fast rivers you flitted. 
You wanted, my little child, 
To avenge your friends, your comrades 
To avenge little children 
And the torturing of the Soviet people. 
Such a fate fell upon you, 
Little child of my heart, 
A flock of wild kites flew upon you.)264 
Chichaeva includes all of the aspects of Zoia‘s character that Aliger had introduced 
in her narrative poem and plays: Zoia‘s purity, her drive to avenge her people, her 
dedication to Stalin. She does not add to the Zoia myth, but merely repackages 
Aliger‘s Zoia and presents her in the form of a folkloric character. She emphasizes 
Zoia‘s active participation in the war effort by describing her flight to the land far 
beyond the mountains to battle the foe of her nation and people, but she leaves Zoia 
unarmed. The reader, or listener, can clearly picture the little bird‘s swiftly beating 
wings, as her small body flies into danger. Chichaeva then concludes her novina by 
264 ......., .. ...... ... ....-......, 3-4. 

131 
noting how the Soviet people come together to avenge Zoia‘s death: ... ......, 
...... ..... .....-........,/ ........ ..... .. ...... ......!.(.We will 
burn, singe the enemy with fiery flames,/ We will take revenge on the enemy for 
Tania‘s death!.)265 
Like Chichaeva‘s novina, Lev Arnshtam‘s film Zoia also mirrors the clear 
trend in the media: the state was reverting back to traditional gender roles. Although 
Arnshtam emphasizes Zoia‘s abilities as a fighter, opening the film with a fighter 
clipping wire and then preparing to launch a lit can toward a building before being 
thrown to the ground by a larger Nazi soldier, he re-feminizes her at the same time. 
No pictures of Zoia with long hair exist, yet the actress wears her hair long, cutting 
her hair only when she becomes a partisan. Like Aliger, Arnshtam transforms Zoia 
into a girlish, romantic heroine, with a love interest. He might have intended to 
make Zoia more likeable with this refeminization. Furthermore, by including a 
boyfriend, who might have become a husband, the director shows her potential as a 
wife and mother. 
Although Zoia was widely embraced, her biography leaves questions. 
Throughout the Soviet period and into the post-Soviet era, the validity of Zoia‘s 
story was buttressed by witness‘ reports. A supposed witness, A. S. Shmatkov writes 
in the December 2, 1966, Kaluzhsky oblast‘ version of Krasnoe Znamia: ... 
........... .... .., ... .. .... ...... ....... ... ................ 
(.And seeing Zoia Kosmodem‘ianskaia‘s death before my very eyes was 
265 Ibid., 9.

staggering.).266 He describes the effect her words had on him: .. .. ....., ... 
........ ........ ........... .. ...... . .... ...... ......... ..... . .. 
............, .. ........... ...., ... .. ......., ... ....., ... .. 
.........., .. ........ (.I don‘t remember what the partisan said word for

there were many of us, that they could not hang all of us, that we would be 
victorious.).267 In a 2005 documentary, ... ...............: ...... . ....... 
(.Zoia Kosmodem'ianskaia: The Truth about her Feat.), Zoia‘s comrade-in-arms 
Klavdiia Miroradova, remembers identifying Zoia‘s body.268 
The real story of Zoia‘s background and death continues to be debated to this 
day. Some question whether or not Zoia‘s body was the mutilated body in 
Strunnikov‘s photograph and whether or not Nazis even occupied the village of 
Petrishchevo.269 In 1991, the leading doctor of the children‘s psychiatric ward of the 
scientific-methodical center claimed that the hospital‘s archives indicate that Zoia 
had been diagnosed with schizophrenia when she was fourteen years old.270 This 
issue has been debated in the media ever since. In The Living and the Dead, Nina 
Tumarkin relates what she calls .the story of the real Zoya,. told to her by Lazar 
Lazarev, Lev Arnshtam‘s friend: Zoia‘s father was shot in 1930s and Zoia‘s mother

pushed Zoia toward self-sacrifice.271 Zoia‘s mother actively campaigned for Zoia 
being named a Hero of the Soviet Union and she pushed her younger child, 
Aleksandr, to join the war effort when still underage. Perhaps one will never know 
how much of the Zoia myth is grounded in reality, and, there is tangible evidence 
that the Zoia myth changed during the Soviet period. In post-1953 reproductions of 
Lidov‘s .....,. editors omitted references to Zoia‘s spiritual .father..272 The Zoia 
of Vladimir Dmitrievich Uspensky‘s 1989 documentary narrative is less iconic than 
earlier versions. 
After the initial, spontaneous outpouring of outrage and grief, the Soviet 
authorities took control of the situation and carefully shaped its citizens‘ response to 
Zoia. When it was decided that readers had sent too many poems to editors of 
journals, the tears were made to stop flowing. For example, the editors of the journal 
Oktiabr. refused to publish a reader‘s poem ...........: ... ...............,. 
claiming that it was poorly written and that .. ... ............... ........ 
..... ....., .......... ..... ...., ... .............. ....... .... (.So 
much has already been written about Zoia Kosmodem'ianskaia, it is risky to choose a 
theme that has been used so many times).273 Such documents show that the 
authorities were curbing readers‘ spontaneous enthusiasm. 
Why did Zoia‘s story touch Soviet citizenry to such an extent? Although 
authors‘ depictions of her vary from text to text, certain elements remain the same.

134 
The heroic martyr dies a noble death for her Motherland and her people, defending 
its capital from fascist invaders. The unifying figure of Zoia is effective because of 
her character (resolute, brave, strong), willingness to sacrifice herself in fulfillment 
of heroic deeds, and her origins. As Cottam argues, she most likely earned her 
legacy because of the time and place of her death. In late November 1941, Nazi 
troops were approaching Moscow and the Soviets were coping with a ruinous 
situation. Zoia‘s picture was circulated among the public, and her name came to 
symbolize the virtues that Stalin needed most during that time: resilience and selfsacrifice.
274 Almost overnight she came to represent all Russians, urban and rural, 
unlike Liza Chaikina, who died one week before Zoia but was from the provinces, 
from a village near Tver‘. Although born in the Tambov region, Zoia grew up in 
Moscow and was perceived as being from Moscow. Authors would emphasize her 
origins. In Arnshtam‘s film, right after the Nazis beat Zoia, Moscow appears on the 
screen, accompanied by glorious music and followed by happy scenes from Zoia‘s 
childhood. By juxtaposing her final moments with scenes from her idyllic 
childhood, he contrasts the terrors of war with the .happy. Moscow life that 
preceded it. Certainly a part of Zoia‘s national appeal lay in her geographical and 
spiritual proximity to the heart of Russia. 
The process of sanctification and elevation to a higher sphere of ideological 
authority is marked by the shift in representation of female body from brave 
muscular fighter to superhumanly brave martyr. Although the body is mutilated, the

Soldiers (Nepean, Canada: New Military Publishing, 1998), 298. 

135 
warrior-martyr is not a victim. She is an extraordinary spirit, remarkably brave. Her 
mind and heart thoroughly control her body. When we look at the limp body, we see 
her proud, great spirit, the spirit present during her childhood, that illuminated her 
from inside and .shone through her skin.. 
When the .silent,. but superhumanly strong-of-spirit martyr speaks out, her 
words ring out and resonate across the Soviet world. They carry authority, but only 
because she is .silent as a partisan girl,. even in the face of losing her life in the most 
ghastly of ways. Aliger describes her immortality: she cannot forget .... ....... 
....,/ .. ......./ . .. ...... (.Her maiden‘s body,/ Not dead/ And not alive.)275 
Zoia is sanctified and becomes a bearer of ideology, just as ancient martyrs 
were bearers of the faith. References to ideological truth dominate Aliger‘s narrative 
poem. In In Stalin.s Time: Middleclass Values in Soviet Fiction (1976), Vera 
Dunham argues that authors began to glorify Truth when Truth, the principle that 
held together Bolshevik ideology began to .ring hallow under Stalin‘s rule..276 
Before the war, Zoia plays idyllically with children as her Komsomol Truth, her 
childhood understanding of ideology develops into Bolshevik Truth, her adult 
understanding of the Party. Dunham argues that Aliger‘s poem extols Zoia‘s idyllic 
private world (while her Bolshevik belief system develops) as a promise of the 
postwar future, rather than a realistic picture of the past.277 Like the early 
revolutionary martyrs, Zoia dies for ideology, thus connecting World War II to the

136 
Civil War and revolutionary struggles that preceded it. Aliger stresses that the 
deaths of individuals like Zoia do not lead to the death of Truth. As Nazis torture 
Zoia, a child witness asks her mother why they are torturing her. The mother replies 
... ......, ..........278 The child then asks if the Nazis kill Zoia, would Truth 
die with her. The mother responds:

(Girl, listen to me without trembling 
Listen, you are eleven years old. 
If she will not cry once 
So that monsters would not bother her, 
If she dies, 
But does not surrender, 
That means, 
That her strength is stronger than death.)279 
Marked forever by her death, this child will remember Zoia‘s ordeals and carry on 
the Truth for which she died. Zoia embodies Truth and the Soviet people, but they 
do not die with her. The narrator shows that ideological truth is stronger and larger 
than death. 
Arnshtam‘s film shows us that the Soviet state had .tempered. Zoia and 
prepared her to be a bearer of .Truth.. After her birth into a good, Communist 
278 ......, ....,.157.

137 
family, Arnshtam‘s Zoia is raised in her school where she learns about Russian 
heroes, such as Chkalov and Susanin. She participates in the 1930s militarization: 
she marches with pioneers among fizkul.turisty and learns to shoot well. From her 
early childhood, she is more a part of the great Soviet collective, than a child in an 
individual nuclear family. 
Zoia‘s story provides an example for Komsomol youth who are themselves 
coming of age ideologically. In Aliger‘s poem, just before the war, Zoia had been 
absorbed with existential questions: .Who am I supposed to become?. and .What is 
happiness?. She had considered becoming a teacher, but wanted to affect more than 
a few lives.280 The narrator notes that it was not her fate to become a schoolteacher. 
By the end of the narrative, both questions have been answered: happiness is dying 
for your country and for Truth and it was Zoia‘s fate to become a martyr for the 
cause, to witness her faith. She was meant to become someone more than a 
schoolteacher: she was meant to be a national hero, to shape the lives of millions of 
children and to lead them on the path to communism. As she lies on the snow, dead 
in body, but alive in spirit, she becomes a symbol of Soviet Truth and strength for 
the Soviet people.281 
Aliger transforms Zoia into someone larger than life by emphasizing the 
ideological aspects of her character. Of course, in doing so, Aliger is following the 
usual Soviet recipe, making Zoia embody ideology [ideinost.] [belief in Truth], 
party-mindedness (partiinost.) [dedication to Stalin and Komsomol], and, 
280 Ibid., 131-2. 
281 Ibid., 171. 

138 
particularly, national-feeling (narodnost.) [love for the people and the Motherland]. 
She instructs the her readers: ......... ....... .......... ..../ ., ......., 
...... .. ........ .. ....../ ... ....... ....,/ .. ......./ . .. ...... 
(.Keep Zoia‘s photograph forever/ I, likely will never be able to forget her./ This 
girl‘s body,/ not dead/ and not alive.).282 She helps to create an iconic, .eternal. 
Zoia from the final image of her dead face: ... .. ...... ..... ...../ . 
.........,/ ........,/ ...... ..... (.But we will recognize Zoia‘s traits/ in her 
thrown back/ wonderful,/ and eternal face.).283 In her narrative poem, Aliger 
establishes the plot elements, characteristics, and ideological concepts which make 
up the canonical Zoia narrative. 
Arnshtam also depicts the development of ideology in his film. One might 
question Stites‘s assertion that the film is a .brilliantly executed Soviet fairytale,. 
since the heroine is tortured and dies.284 Regardless of the physical pain Zoia 
experiences during her last moments, the film does include the requisite .happy 
ending. of a fairy tale. The director threads the theme of personal happiness 
through his film. As Zoia develops into a Komsomol warrior, we see her ask the 
question: .What is happiness?. and come to an appropriate conclusion: happiness is 
dying for one‘s country. The director includes shots of a hand asking the question 
and developing the answer in a schoolgirl‘s notebook. Happiness and torture are 
interwoven as the director cuts from scenes of her torture and execution to childhood

139 
scenes. Viewers were surely mourning loved ones. Arnshtam‘s film shows that the 
deceased, like Zoia, died happy and fulfilled, since they were dying for their country 
and for Stalin. The film inspires hope in the future victory of the Red Army by 
including final scenes of westward bound tanks, victory made possible by loyal 
daughters like Zoia. 
Zoia‘s image did not fade after the conclusion of the Soviet Union. In 
contrast, postwar works cement Zoia‘s transformation into a saint. Her story was 
codified in Liubov‘ Kosmodem‘ianskaia‘s hagiographic biography, The Story of 
Zoia and Shura (....... . ... . ....). Liubov‘, the narrator, portrays her as a 
Soviet saint, indeed, as a Christ figure. This image of Zoia has no faults. As a child 
and young woman, she is wise beyond her years. The text concludes with the 
narrator looking at children and thinking that her two children and others died so that 
these children could live happily. 
Liubov‘ attempts to take control of her daughter‘s legacy and corrects certain 
mistakes, such as the portrayal of Zoia as an only child in Arnshtam‘s film.285 
Written after the war and the subsequent demobilization of women, the narrator 
disarms Zoia. The narrator uses the existence of a younger brother to transform Zoia 
into a quieter, more passive character. As children, Shura is more spontaneous and 
aggressive and Zoia is more domestic. He plays with friends outside while 
responsible Zoia cares for the house. Although we know she learns how to handle a

weapon, we never see her shooting. The State decorates Zoia for her noble death 
rather than any harm inflicted on the enemy. Shura is named a Hero of the Soviet 
Union for his participation in a tank battle. Liubov‘s inclusion of pages of detailed 
information on Zoia‘s upbringing transforms the work into a guide for parents, in 
addition to an example for Soviet children. From The Story of Zoia and Shura the 
reader learns how to raise children like Zoia and Shura. Schoolchildren were 
required to read Liubov‘s biography through the Soviet period. 
Nikolai Aleksandrovich Borisov‘s books We Will Be Like Zoia (1965) and In 
Zoia.s Name (1975) document saint-like devotion to Zoia. Borisov, the director of 
School 201, Zoia‘s former school, documents how pioneers and students at her 
former school in Moscow honor her memory. He includes poems created by 
children in her memory and photos of famous citizens visiting places of significance: 
.......-......... .. .. ..... ..... .. ...... .... (.The pilot-astronaut G. S. 
Titov sits at Zoia‘s desk.).286 He describes pioneers‘ moving experiences when they 
make pilgrimages to Petrishchevo. They plant trees in her honor and sing about 
Zoia. The cover of In Zoia.s Name shows an eternal flame and Zoia‘s iconic school 
portrait. With his books, he simultaneously documents and contributes to her cult. 
Artist Oleg Komov‘s 1986 sculpture, that replaced Manizer‘s grave marker in 
the Novodevich‘e cemetery, represents a final stage in the Zoia myth. Unarmed, the 
figure on the grave appears to be a hanged woman, minus the rope. Her left breast is 
bare, again recalling her mutilation of the body, and she has a relatively curvy body, 
286 .. ......., ....., ... ... (......: ............ ......, 1965), 92. 

141 
nothing like the portraits of Zoia. Although her arms are free, her bare feet seem to 
be bound. Appropriately, this body appears to be floating upward, stressing the 
spiritual over the corporeal (figure 23). 
Tumarkin argues that dead heroes were more useful than the living to the 
makers of cultural myths because they could not interfere with the stories told about 
them, not embarrass themselves, nor could they make demands after the war.287 
1942 marks a change in the official Soviet attitude to women warriors, evident in 
decoration of female Heroes of the Soviet Union. The change of focus from the 
highly skilled woman, victorious in battle, to the self-sacrificing Soviet daughter is 
evident by the choice of first female heroes of the Soviet Union after the start of the 
war. The first three female Heroes of the Soviet Union were involved in 
underground or partisan activities and were decorated posthumously. None of these 
women held rank as soldiers, but they gave their lives while resisting Nazi 
occupation of their Motherland. This change of decoration accompanies the most 
difficult period of the war for the Soviet people. 
The woman warrior-martyr is celebrated for her selfless devotion to the 
Soviet State rather than her individual actions, which is typical of Stalinist period. 
Her physical body is significant only in its mutilated form, which transcends the 
physical and ascends to the mythological realm. She can be characterized by her 
boundless love for her homeland. She is follows the Great Father, Stalin, to her very

death. She is silent when she must be, but proclaims inspiring, immortal words to 
her comrades at the threshold of death, as she is rising to sainthood. 
The Soviet public embraced and glorified these idealized daughters and 
memorialized them, and held their mutilated bodies up to act as bearers of ideology 
and examples of devotion to the Motherland for generations of children. Although 
their role in the post-Soviet period has been unclear, as Russians have questioned the 
validity of Soviet myths and the Zoia story, the majority of monuments and 
geographical street markers remain. Websites and the 2005 documentary shows that 
she remains a collective source of national pride and a symbol of strength and 
courage of the World War II generation. Most Russians continue to venerate her, 
visiting her gravesite in Moscow and the Minsk highway monument, a bound, 
unarmed, dress-wearing young woman, in Petrishchevo. The most famous woman 
warrior-martyrs are enjoying renewed attention, as Russians reevaluate the 
mythology of World War II (figure 24).

After the prewar military buildup of the Soviet state World War II, the vast 
majority of women soldiers had been demobilized shortly after the war‘s end, in the 
fall of 1945.291 Having fought heroically and successfully, many women expected to 
be remembered and honored as heroes, as patriotic daughters who had defended their 
Motherland. Instead, Soviet writers largely forgot their contributions, ignoring the 
women who participated in combat entirely and focusing instead on women in 
traditional, nurturing roles. As the war concluded, images of happy, smiling mothers 
holding children replaced pictures of women warriors. Although some women, 
especially pilots, hoped to continue military service or flying, most were demobilized 
after the war. Pilot Klavdiia Pankratova told Ann Noggle, .And then it came to who 
should retire. It was not the men, of course; I was made to retire, and I didn‘t want 
to. Later I wanted to go into civil aviation, but they hated fighter pilots; they didn‘t 
take me. So I had to quit flying..292 
The two first epigraphs likely frustrated and disappointed many women who 
participated in the Great Patriotic War. These depictions in literature are 
representative of a much broader cultural trend that followed World War II. 
Although they had gained access to the military in the 1930s, women lost the right to

(In the years of the Great Patriotic War, Evdokiia Bershanskaia commanded 
the glorious women‘s Taman Guards aviation regiment, formed by 
volunteers, educated in flight clubs and air force flight schools. As they 
fearlessly fought against the fascist invaders, female pilots dreamt of the time 
after victory when they would build, create. They dreamt of happiness, of 
family... Evdokiia Davydovna Bershanskaia is now a happy mother of three. 
As before, she is active in society. She is the assistant party secretary of the 
First Moscow Municipal Flight Club of DOSAAF.293 
Bershanskaia, in civilian dress and now a .mother of three children,. shows her 
daughter her decorated uniform. Although she continues to work in aviation, her 
role as a mother is supposed to fulfill her. Covers of Rabotnitsa in the postwar 
period show that Soviet women were expected to devote themselves to raising 
families.294 
This chapter explores the cultural disarming that complemented the literal 
disarming of women soldiers. It investigates the male .gaze,. by which I mean, the 
objectifying view of a man, and the male author‘s intentionality. I ask how male 
writers, typically representatives of the literary elite, and most widely respected to 
293 ......... 2 (February 1954), color plate between 8 and 9. 
294 Examples: ......... 8 (August 1949): inside cover; ......... 10 (October 1950): cover.

this day, respond to women warriors and how their responses conform to and dissent 
from official state positions. 
Descriptions in the first and second epigraphs above illustrate typical male 
writers‘ portrayals of women soldiers. They were written by Emmanuil Kazakevich 
and Vasil‘ Bykov, respected members of the postwar literary elite. The Kazakevich 
passage emphasizes the woman soldier‘s feminine qualities, which many famous 
male authors idealize. Like most female soldiers, she disrupts the typically all-male 
world of war. Bykov more pointedly disarms his female partisan, emphasizing her 
inability to bear weapons and showing the distrust men had in women soldiers. 
The third epigraph resists male writers‘ refeminization of female soldiers. 
The author, Iuliia Drunina, remains the only woman warrior celebrated as an 
important writer. In her diverse body of poetry about World War II, although she 
addresses women‘s experiences in World War II, her self-image is built on her active 
duty in the military and resists the focus of the male gaze on the female body in a 
shapely, fitted uniforms. She can only laugh as men transform women soldiers into 
complements whose roles in the war were mostly limited to fulfilling men‘s needs 
and desires. 
Reina Pennington argues that the demobilization of women in the military 
was accompanied by displacement in postwar fiction.295 Some male authors, for 
example Viktor Nekrasov (1911-87), author of Stalin Prize-winning novel In the 
295 Pennington, Wings, Women, and War, vi. 

147 
Trenches of Stalingrad (. ...... ..........., 1947),296 avoid the topic of women 
soldiers entirely, as if 800,000 women had not fought on the front.297 Although 
Nekrasov does mention a woman, Liusia, who works in a hospital in Stalingrad, she 
is hardly a woman warrior. Although the reader learns of her attractive body, 
literary taste, and about her piano-playing abilities, he or she never sees Liusia in 
uniform, armed, or working as a military soldier. She functions only as the love 
interest for the narrator, as a woman who reminds him of his childhood sweetheart 
back in Kiev. Women soldiers, as Pennington shows, remain absent in the entirety 
of Nekrasov‘s oeuvre. 
Most well-known writers, however, portrayed women soldiers in some 
capacity in their war literature. These writers almost always depicted them in the 
manner similar to that in the epigraphs. The women in these works either conformed 
to a traditional feminine role by being emotional, desirable nurturers or fought 
incompetently, hindering the war effort rather than contributing to it, or both.298 This 
treatment of the woman warrior is not limited to works by Russian male authors. 
Sharon Macdonald describes the two ways women warriors are .disarmed. in 
general in culture: either her .feminine nature. is stressed and she is made to uphold 
feminine virtues (chastity, shame, maternal nurturing), her heroism is downplayed, 
or her participation in warfare is shown to be a result of an exceptional circumstance; 
296 Deming Brown refers to the novel as one of the finest novels of the war in Soviet Russian 
Literature since Stalin (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1978), 271. 
297 Pennington, Wings, Women, and War, 1. 
298 Sometimes authors will combine these approaches, as in Bykov's ...... . .. ..........

or she is shown to be insufficiently feminine, .unnatural,. or abnormal.299 Fears 
about society judging them abnormal in their nontraditional combat service led many 
actual women to conceal their military service. In his introduction to Iuliia 
Drunina‘s Country—Youth (...... ......, 1967), Sergei Narovchatov recalls a 
chance meeting with a former comrade-in-arms and her boyfriend: 
..............., ... ........ .... . ....... . ......... .........: 
=...... .. ......, ... . .... ........... ......, ... ...... .. 
..........,‘300 (.Having greeted each other, she pulled me to the side and quickly 
whispered: =Only don‘t say that I was a nurse! You know, now it‘s not really 
valued.). It is important to remember, however, that there were respected male 
writers who celebrated fighting women, most notably Il‘ia Erenburg (1891-1967) 
and Boris Vasil‘ev (1924-present).301 
299 Sharon Macdonald, Pat Holden, and Shirley Ardener, eds. Images of Women in Peace and War: 
Cross-Cultural and Historical Perspectives (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press: 1988), 7. 
300 .... ......., ...... ...... (......: .............. .........., 1967), 7. 
301 In 1948, Il‘ia Erenburg published The Storm (....), a Stalin prize-winning, epic novel about 
World War II, set in the Soviet Union and France. Erenburg‘s novel stands out from Soviet war 
novels in the immediate postwar period by both deviating from the party line and including welldeveloped 
portraits of women soldiers who participated in warfare in various capacities. He develops 
his characters, male and female, and explores their motivations. In The Storm, Erenburg shows the 
breadth of women‘s service by writing about partisan scouts, a sniper, and nurses. Although in his 
novel he includes rich portraits of armed women warriors, a traditional, nurturing woman Natasha 
Dmitrievna Krylova-Vlakhova, a nurse, occupies the most important place in the narrative and 
survives to raise her child and live with her husband, showing the predominance of this type of 
character in the writing of a talented, relatively evenhanded male author. This chapter will return to 
Natasha later to examine her portrayal in greater detail. 
Another exception to this pattern, Boris Vasil‘ev, also includes depictions of a variety of women 
soldiers in his works about World War II, fifteen of which have become feature films.301 In his 1969 
novella, .The Dawns are Quiet. (.. .... ..... ......), a career soldier, Sergeant-Major Vaskov, 
leads a squad of five women anti-aircraft gunners on a search for Germans, reconnoitering in the 
Russian rear. Vasil‘ev portrays the women as warriors, who contribute actively and violently to the 
war effort, even if they do baffle male soldiers who do not fully understand how to treat female 
subordinates. He presents the women as individuals, describes their physical appearances, 
personalities, and individual motivations which led the women to enlist as soldiers on the front. 

149 
When writing about women soldiers in World War II, male authors typically 
re-feminize the woman warrior, creating what we will call a .woman warriorhandmaiden,. 
a woman character who is subservient, nurturing, and sexually 
attractive, who acts a complement to a male character. She serves in a nonviolent 
capacity, usually as a nurse, radio operator, or translator. In keeping with the 
traditional male gaze, her body is of paramount interest and the reader always knows 
what she looks like, but not always what she thinks. Her role in novels and movies 
lies not in heroic feats or death, but in her relationship to a male character. One may 
question how such a character can be considered a woman warrior. I include her, not 
only because she appears on the front as a uniformed soldier and is sometimes 
armed, but because when questioned about examples of women soldiers, Russians 
themselves name these women. Handmaidens began appearing in the works of male 
authors shortly after the turning point of the war. As the figure below shows, authors 
and filmmakers continue to create works including handmaiden characters into the 
twenty-first century.

Table B: Authors and Works that Feature the Handmaiden 
The character traits of the handmaiden type show a refeminized woman. They reject 
both the blurring of gender roles of the 1930s and the expanded roles offered to 
women in the midst of war. Now that the war had finished, the State tried to put 
Pandora back in her box. By limiting women‘s role in combat and by refeminizing 
her in their revisions of the war, writers further emphasized the male soldier‘s 
heroism as something naturally masculine. 
The warrior-handmaiden is first and foremost defined primarily by 
relationship to a military man. The relationship is usually romantic, but 
occasionally, they may share a familial relationship, either as brother and sister or 
father and daughter. In all examples, she cares deeply for the hero and her actions 
are motivated by her feelings for him. For example, in Bykov‘s .The Pack of 

151 
Wolves,. the partisan narrator, Levchuk, reminisces about Klava Shorokhina, a 
partisan and radio operator in his group, whom he once loved. Levchuk goes into the 
forest with her and another soldier, Griboed, in order to evacuate a wounded man, 
Tikhonov. Levchuk is the leader and Klava is always secondary to him, both in 
terms of their actions and her place in the narrative. This traditional relationship, 
based on stereotypes and well-defined gender roles, empowers the male as he always 
assumes a dominant role. 
The handmaiden is also a nurturer, either caring for soldiers or little children. 
Handmaidens are typically nurses or doctors. Even if they serve in other military 
capacities, they usually acquire nursing duties. Bykov‘s Liusia, the .girl-medic. 
(.......-.............)302 in his 1961 story .The Third Missile. (....... 
.......), cares for a wounded man as though he were a child, keeping vigil as he 
dies. In Bykov‘s .The Pack of Wolves. (....... .....), radio operator Klava, 
accompanying two male soldiers on a mission to rescue a wounded comrade, 
happens upon a child: ...... .. ..... . ...... ..... ......... 
............— ............ . ..... ........ ......... . .......,

his mother‘s arms, began to fuss—shaking a bit in his silk sweater and first, crying 
quietly. ... Levchuk turned away and Klava pressed the child to her chest, lightly

152 
covering him with sackcloth.).303 Although Klava had been in possession of a 
Browning pistol at the time the three embarked on their mission, it is implied that she 
has given her weapon to her commanding officer after they encounter Germans. 
Although the reader never sees her using a weapon, or even a radio, the narrator 
provides several descriptions of Klava comforting the baby. 
To the male gaze, the sexual body is more important than actions or thoughts. 
The reader often sees the handmaiden‘s body through a male character‘s eyes. The 
narrator of Kazakevich‘s ....... ...... never ceases describing the translator 
Anichka‘s physical beauty.304 The handmaiden appeals to all senses: she smells 
pleasant and has a beautiful voice. Kazakevich introduces his readers to Anichka 
through her laugh: .. ..... .. ...... ........, ...... ......, ........ 
......., ........... ....... ..... (.And suddenly through the door of the 
hut, very close, loud, silvery, woman‘s laughter could be heard.).305 Later, he 
describes her from the point-of-view of a captured German as ........, .. ... 
........ . . .......... ........ (.a young woman, beautiful, with a melodic 
voice.).306 
Functioning only as a complement to male characters, the handmaiden is 
rarely self-aware. If she has a self-image, she lacks self-assurance. Kazakevich‘s 
Katia in .The Star. imagines herself as a warrior‘s bride rather than a warrior 
herself: ......... . . .......... ........., ... .......... . ...., ........

... ..... ... .... ........... .....—....... ...... (.Smiling in the mirror, 
she looked at it, trying to give her face an expression of ceremonial seriousness and 
pronouncing aloud =bride of a hero‘.).307 She also sees herself as inferior to her 
man: ... ..... . ... ....?—...... ....—.. ..... ....., ........., ...... 
. .... ........., . ... .. ..... ....... . .? ........, ..... .., ... ...... 
....... (.'What kind of partner would I be for him?‘ she thought. =He‘s so smart, 
serious, his sister‘s a violinist, and he himself will be a scholar. And I? A girl, just 
like thousands of others‘.).308 Kazakevich‘s Anichka also finds inadequacies in 
herself: ... ...... .. ........ .... ........ ... ......., ........, ... ... 
..... ......, ..........., ................, ....... ............... 
(.But Anichka did not think much of herself. She thought, in contrast, that she was 
terrible, eccentric, unbalanced, too reflexive.).309 These instances of self-awareness 
are rare, however. The reader never really finds out how the handmaiden sees 
herself. 
One can also he handmaiden by her lack of aggressiveness, of an instinct to 
kill, not only in terms of her official military position, but in her demeanor. She 
never carries a gun and shies away from killing the enemy. This unsuitability for 
combat occasionally leads to a male character disarming the handmaiden. Klava in 
Bykov‘s .The Pack of Wolves. is disarmed when she gives up her weapon to a male 
307 ........., .......,. 85-86. 
308 Ibid., 35. 
309 ....... .....,. 194. 

154 
comrade early in the novella.310 She is often scared of the violence of war, like 
Bykov‘s Klava, who is scared of mines. One may assume that any male soldier 
would also dread landmines, but male authors rarely mention male soldiers‘ fears, 
focusing instead on the apprehensions of female soldiers. Kazakevich‘s Anichka 
fears her comrades will kill a captured German: ...... ... ... ............. 
..... ....., ..... .......... ........ ........, ........ .... ...... . 
....., ...... ....... ...., . ...... ...... ......., ..... .. ..... ...... 
.. ... ......... ...... ... ......... . ......... (.When they had already 
swum across the river, the German mortars opened fire again. They had to lie down 
flat in the dirt, surrounded by exploding mines, and Anichka was terribly scared that 
they would kill the German. But everything turned out. They soon showed up at 
Remizov‘s.).311 Her innate preference for peace leads her to dread violence, 
regardless of its object. 
The handmaiden is emotional and weeps frequently. In Bykov‘s .The Pack 
of Wolves,. Klava‘s incompetence results in tears throughout her military 
experience. Klava cries out of shame after sleeping through a shift on the night 
watch: ........ .. ..... .. ...., ......, ... ... ........ ........ .... 
...... . ..... ...... ...... . ... ... ... ........ ........ ... .... 
......... .... ... .... .........-.........., . ...... ..... .... .. 
................ .. ......., .. .... .. .. ..... ... ...... (.She cried from

155 
irreverently pitied her.). 312 In addition to her emotional weakness, the handmaiden 
is physically ill fit for combat. Klava later cries when she becomes exhausted, 
fleeing Germans: 
..... ...... .. .... . ........, ....... ..... ....... ........ .

......... 
(Klava lay on her side and she looked at the pines with big eyes, full of grief. 
--You have gotten fed up with me troubling you. Excuse me, Levchuk...she 
suddenly started to cry, quietly and mournfully, but he sat close, stretching 
his red, sore feet toward the sun, and was quiet. He did not console her 
because he could not comfort her, since he felt that Klava herself was guilty 
in what had happened to her. Quietly sobbing, Klava cried for a long time, 
and in the end Levchuk could not bear it.)313 
Her tears show that she is not fit for combat. She can neither fulfill duties nor 
control her emotions. Military service seems overly taxing, almost cruel, for the 
handmaiden and her comparatively delicate emotional constitution. 
The handmaiden is dependent. She needs men and her decisions and actions 
are motivated by this need. In Bykov‘s "His Battalion" (.... ........,. 1975), a 
pregnant medic, Vera Veretennikova, resists transfer from the front, not because she 
believes that motherhood and combat are compatible, but because she refuses to 
leave the baby‘s father, the company commander. (.=...... . .. ...... ..

away from Vad‘ka,‘ she said. However, her resolve, it seemed, weakened, and the 
girl sobbed and covered her face with her hands. . She disobeys orders and remains 
with the battalion during an attack, which results in her death. 
While narrators often refer to male soldiers by their last names or ranks, men 
almost always call female soldiers by diminutive forms of their first names, 
indicating a lower place in the military hierarchy. Male soldiers tend to address 
female soldiers, using the informal .ty,. while women often respond to men with the 
formal .vy.. Kazakevich writes:

(Raising his eyes, [Remizov] saw the young woman and suddenly, amazed, 
and exclaimed .Anichka, how did you end up here?. 
The girl looked at him, all lit up, embraced his neck and cried: 
.Semen Fomich, old boy! What are you doing here?. 
.I‘ll tell you later,. mumbled the lieutenant, looking askance and blushing 
deeply. 
.You‘re on the front? Here? And where is your father?.)315 
In the Kazakevich excerpt, the use of familiar address indicates a familial, paternal 
order, emphasizing the woman soldier‘s subordinate position in the military family,

beloved and appreciated as an obedient daughter. He also affirms her dependence on 
family by asking about an authority figure. 
The warrior-handmaiden is the keeper of the hearth, representing home and 
safety. Bykov depicts Katia by the hearth, cooking for her wounded charges in .The 
Dead Feel No Pain.: ...... ....., ..... ......., ........ ........ .

Katia were busying themselves, boiling potatoes. Katia without her coat, was

moving the stock pots on the stove.).316 One of the characters reminds another that 
......—.. .... ....... (.War is not your dear mother.),317 but Katia, who 
remains a nurturer to her death literally embodies the hearth, and the comforting 
presence of a maternal figure. The wounded narrator longs for her: ... ........

The handmaiden is eternally loyal, faithful, and devoted, even after there is 
no hope of her beloved‘s return. Kazakevich‘s Katia in .The Star. continues to wait 
for Travkin by her radio, and to call his name, long after everyone else has given up 
hope. In the 2002 film, we learn that after the war, she returns home to her small 
village and never marries, remaining faithful to Travkin until her death. Erenburg‘s 
Natasha in The Storm embodies the loyalty and faithfulness expressed in Konstantin 
Simonov‘s popular 1941 poem, .Wait for me. (.... .....). Her husband Vasia 
has been missing for three years. She has no news of him, but her love does not 
diminish. She accepts his death, but also realizes that she will never love again. The 
handmaiden does not remain faithful and devoted because she feels she has to, but 
because she cannot be anything else. She is a .good girl. and faithful by nature. 
Through the handmaiden‘s love, the author restores the value to an individual‘s life 
that the Soviet state ignored. The man the handmaiden loves is irreplaceable. 
Poet, novelist, and journalist Konstantin Simonov (1915-79) dedicated much 
of his career to writing about the Great Patriotic War. In both Days and Nights (... 
. ...., 1943-44) and The Living and the Dead (..... . ......., 1959-1970), the 
male protagonist meets, falls in love with, and marries a medical practitioner. 
Although the plot of the epic The Living and the Dead is considerably more 
complex, the women soldiers are remarkably similar, despite the more than twentyfive 
years that separate the publication of these two novels. The male protagonists 
save the lives of both women early in the novels. The women espouse traditional 
dreams of family life. They are infantilized throughout the works and in both of

them. Simonov addresses the idea of women bearing arms. Men disapprove of 
women‘s participation in combat, claiming that the difficulties of war are too intense 
for women. 
The nurse Ania (Days and Nights) and the military doctor Tania (The Living 
and the Dead) both physically need their future spouses early in the works. Ania, 
unable to swim, would have drowned had Saburov not rescued her when their barge 
is attacked, crossing the Volga River. Tania sprains her ankle and needs Sintsov to 
carry her through Nazi-occupied territory. Simonov shows how women, regardless 
of their skills, need male soldiers for their survival in combat situations. 
Shortly after their introductions, the women‘s roles in the novel is clarified: 
she exists to fulfill the protagonist‘s needs. Although they serve in the military, their 
expectations and hopes for the future do not deviate from traditional norms: they 
long for peacetime so that they can become wives and mothers. Shortly after their 
meeting, Ania describes her greatest fears to Saburov: ........, ... ..... 
.....,—. ...... ..... .... .. .... ... . ... . ...... ....., ..... ....., 
... ..... ..... ..... .. ...... . ...., . ......, ...... .. ...... (.I dreamt 
of getting married, and that did not happen either...and I sometimes am scared, very 
scared, that suddenly all of this won‘t be. I will die, and nothing, nothing will 
be.).319 When Tania envisions her future, she sees herself as a wife. Upon marriage, 
both women hope to remain on the same front as their husbands. However, after 
Tania becomes pregnant, she leaves for the rear.

160 
While the women serve as the protagonists‘ objects of desire and as nurturers, 
anticipating their potential as mothers, narrators in both novels transform the women 
into children. In Days and Nights, the narrator uses the child leitmotif in 
descriptions of Ania‘s actions: ... ..... .., . ... ...... ...... . ...., 
........, .. ......., ... ......... ....... .... .......... (.He poured 
her a drink, and she drank together with them, peacefully, not wrinkling up her face, 
as an obedient child drinks medicine.).320 This excerpt emphasizes her obedience. 
She would likely be an obedient, submissive wife as well. Like a child, she is easily 
pleased: .. .... ........,--........ ....... ..., ....., ....... . ......, 
.... .. .... ., ..-...... ............ .. ........, . .......... ........: 
—.., ....., . ..... .. ..... .. ...... (.=I, too, will fall asleep,‘ she said 
confidently, then, going to the couch, sat on it, and like a child bounced on it, and 
with surprise noted, .Oh, it‘s soft. I haven‘t slept on such a couch for a long 
time.).321 The following excerpt emphasizes Ania‘s natural childlike nature. None 
of her actions are affected: ......... ... . ....... ................... 
............. . ........., ... . ....., ...... .. .......... ..... 
....... ...... (.she added with childlike spontaneity the idea about parents, like 
people, not understanding the simplest things.).322 Ania‘s actions constantly 
emphasize the deficit in age and experience between herself and her beloved.

322 Ibid., 61. 

161 
Likewise, from the introduction of Tania, the narrator emphasizes her smallness and 
youth. The reader sees her through male eyes: 
....... .... ........... . ..... ........., ... ........ ...... 
......... ........ . ........ ..... . ... ......, .. . ..., ... ... 
......, ........ .. ... . .......... . .......... .. ......... . 
........ ... ........., ..... ..., ... ........ ....., ..... . .....

(The woman doctor was so young and tiny, that she seemed just like a girl. 
Serpilin and Sintsov, standing near him, and those who were around them 
looked at her with surprise and tenderness. Their surprise and tenderness 
were strengthened when she, chewing on a crust of bread, began talking 
about herself in response to their questions).323 
This description of Tania follows a passage in which she has shot a German, despite 
the weight of her rifle: ...... ... ..... ......., ... .. ........ ........, 
..... ... ..... ....... (.The revolver was so heavy that when she had to shoot, 
she had to hold it with two hands.).324 Tania kills the soldier out of necessity and 
self-defense and her near inability to handle a weapon gives evidence of her 
unsuitability in a capacity other than that of a nurturer. Even when honored for 
partisan service, the narrator emphasizes her girlishness: ......., ......., 
....... .. ... ......, . ......., ..... ..... . ........ .. ...., ......... 
.. ... . ......, ............ .........., ...... ... .... ...., ... .. .... 
..... .......... ....... ...... ........ ....... ..... ......... 
......... ........ . ....... ...... (.Her smile, probably, made her look 
even younger, and Kalinin, giving out the medal and extending his hand toward her, 
he looked at her with the kind compassion of an elder, as if he were particularly sorry

324 Ibid., 2-172. 

162 
that in this war, he had to hand out orders of the Red Banner to such little, shorthaired 
girls in military uniforms.).325 Sintsov loves Tania‘s childlike characteristics: 
... ..... .. ....., ..... ... ....,-........., ........., ......, ... 
........ (.He loved her just as she was: little, thin, light as a child.).326 Simonov‘s 
habit of comparing women soldiers to children disarms them, making them less 
formidable in the eyes of the reader. 
In the novels, the narrator emphasizes the woman soldiers‘ body and clothing 
as a crucial part of refeminization (after they have fallen in love with the 
protagonists). In ... . ...., Ania receives women‘s clothing from her mother: 
... ... ....... ....... ...., . . ... ...... ........ .... ...-..... 
...... ....... ...... .... ... . ....., ... . .... . .. .... ... ..... 
...... .... ... ... .. ......?. 
... .... .. ...., ........ .... .. .... . ......... ..........

(.My sister-in-law gave me some cloth, so now I‘m sewing a dress for Anya. 
After all, she is a young girl. Even if she wears a dress only once a month— 
well, I‘ll still make one for her ... But she hasn‘t any shoes. Maybe I could 
give here these?. 
She sat on the chair, put one leg over the other, and thoughtfully 
looked at her old, patched, low-heeled slippers.)328 
This clothing represents Ania‘s .true,. feminine self, the woman who will return 
once circumstances allow her to retire her uniform. Her mother‘s use of the word 
.girl. (devchonka) emphasizes her femininity while also reenforcing her 
childishness.

163 
In The Living and the Dead, Tania‘s preference for the role of lover over that 
of a soldier is made explicit by a decision to remain unarmed voluntarily, 
immediately after she and Sintsov have consummated their relationship: ... ...... 
. .......... ............. ..... .. ....... .. ...., .... ... . ...., .. 
..... ............, . ........ ..... ..... .. ...., .......... . ...... ., 
..... .. ......... ..... ... ......., ....... ..........-.... .. ...., 
..... . .......... . ..... ........ .... .............. (.Her belt which 
held her pistol was actually lying on the armchair. But Tania, having grabbed it in 
her hands, did not begin putting it on, but laid it between herself and the table, and 
dropped into the chair. Looking at Sintsov, who was standing in front of her, she 
sighed deeply, =If only you knew how happy and tired I am. I'm weak in the 
knees‘.)329 Rather than getting dressed and donning her belt and gun, Tania smokes 
with her lover and discusses her personal happiness. 
Both novels conclude ambiguously, with the women‘s lives in peril, after 
they have been wounded, having participated in unexpected combat scenes. Ania is 
wounded severely when the Germans appear, while she is bandaging a wounded 
soldier. She is frightened when they appear, but arms herself, grabbing a gun and 
shooting blindly: ....., ... ...... ......... ..... . ...-.. .......,--... 
... ........ .. ... ..... ....... ....... ......... ... ..... .......,

painfully hit Ania in the face. It was the dead radio operator‘s machine gun, lying on 
the bottom of the trench. She picked up the machine gun, laid it on the breastwork, 
and having gotten up, like the second radio operator, she began shooting, not seeing 
where she was shooting.).330 By noting that she shoots blindly, the narrator 
minimizes the effectiveness of her actions: she almost certainly wounded no one. 
After shooting, she drops a gun in order to throw a grenade out of the trench. It 
explodes with the handle still in her hand. She is not disfigured, but badly hurt, 
carried across the Volga to a field hospital, where her role in the novel ends. The 
reader does not know whether she will survive and her husband assumes that she is 
dead. 
Although Tania conforms to the handmaiden type in most respects, she is 
unusual in that she enters and exits the plot of the novel through battle. She is 
wounded when the Nazis attack the medical transport vehicle in which she is riding. 
Surrounded by Germans, her driver shot, Tania must shoot four Germans in order to 
survive:

(Having remembered the machine gun, lying by her back, she harnessed it to 
her belt and so, not getting up, continuing to sit for some reason on the 
footboard of the truck, she pressed the machine gun to her stomach and from 
it, fired a burst at the Germans. At first it was a long one, at all, and then she 
330 ......., ... . ...., 218. 

165 
managed to also fire a short burst at a German, running quite close to the 
truck, who was lifting up a grenade).331 
Although Tania had previously claimed to possess rifley skills, her handling of 
weaponry in this passage shows that she is ill at ease in combat. 
The novel concludes with Tania‘s evacuation from the front and Sintsov‘s 
difficult decision whether he should remain with Tania or return to his prewar wife, 
previously thought deceased. Although Ania and Tania both pick up guns and fire at 
the enemy, they only engage in combat when there are no men to protect them, when 
they are surrounded by Nazis, and have no other choice. Simonov reconciles the 
idea of women handling weapons and taking lives by explaining the desperate 
circumstances that lead to such actions and by emphasizing the women‘s general 
unsuitability for combat, in terms of physical size, lack of fitness and skill, and 
nurturing nature. Ania, Tania, and the Russian women soldiers they represent would 
not have taken up arms if patriotic love for their Motherland and a need to defend 
themselves from attack by the enemy had not required them to do so. These women 
are beautiful, small, and nurturing. They need men, love men, and long for the war 
to be over so that they can raise families alongside their husbands. 
In his widely popular 1947 short story about a group of reconnaissance scouts 
and snipers working behind German lines, E. Kazakevich presents a quintessential 
portrait of a woman warrior-handmaiden. Katia, a radio operator, falls in love with 
the story‘s protagonist, her commanding officer, Travkin, while stationed in a 
Belarusian village. Although she wants to go on a mission with Travkin, he refuses 
331 Ibid., 3-471. 

166 
and retorts to his commander, .=.. ... .., ....... ....., .. ..... ... 
........ .. .. ........ .....‘ (.=What are you thinking, Comrade Major? I 
don‘t need a radio operator. We are not going on a stroll‘.).332 showing his low 
opinion and condescending attitude toward her. She loves him regardless and asks 
another scout to watch out for Travkin, as the group is departing. After Travkin 
leaves on a mission, orbiting the area, as suggested by as his code name, .......,. 
or .Star,. Katia remains in the village, waiting by her radio transmitter, depriving 
herself of sleep and calling his name. She functions as a bridge to the peacetime 
comfort of home and family, as her code name ......,. or .earth. suggests, 
connecting her to the image of the nurturing mother earth. Her character falls into 
one of the folkloric roles for women, that of the soldier‘s wife (soldatka), waiting for 
her lover to return. Together, they represent the universe: the traditionally male sky 
with the feminine earth.333 They represent Russia: urban Travkin, a student of 
science from an educated family, comes from Moscow and civilization, and the 
grandeur of the Soviet Union‘s capital, while Katia comes from a humble village and 
represents quaint rural life, tied to the earth. 
Katia has two roles in the work. First, she connects Travkin to the hearth and 
to life through her symbolic connection to the earth. In her second role, she brings 
.femininity. in the forms of a woman‘s scent and flowers into the otherwise all male 
detachment. While she loves Travkin romantically, she has maternal feelings toward 
332 ........., .......,. 47. 
333 In Russian mythology, gods of the sky, sun, and wind were all male, while the god of the earth was 
female. 

167 
the other soldiers and cares for them as a mother would, worrying about their welfare 
and happiness, singing to them, and even doing their laundry. A fellow soldier, 
Mershcherskii, tells Travkin: .--...... .... ........... ......., ... .. ...... 
.. .... ......, ....... . ... ...... .......... ..... ... ........, ... 
..... ......... .... ......... (.She‘s kind. She does the scouts‘ laundry. 
They read her their letters from home and share their news with her. When she 
comes, they are very happy. She sings beautifully.).334 She even procures a bed and 
table for Travkin. 
We never learn why she enlisted in the army, know nothing of her 
motivations to fight. After she falls in love with Travkin, she is guided entirely by 
her romantic feelings for him. She obeys him when he commands her not to come to 
the detachment‘s gathering place when he is present. The narrator makes it clear that 
she waits by her transmitter beyond her military duties, simply in hopes of hearing 
Travkin‘s voice, not necessarily out of feelings of military necessity

(The radio operators worked in threes, But Katia, having finished her shift, 
did not leave. She sat next to Meshcherskii on the narrow planks, having 
bent her light head on her tanned hands, and waited. Sometimes she 
suddenly began to argue crossly with the watchperson about as if he had lost 
Zvezda‘s wave, snatching away the receiver from his hand, and under the low 
334........., .......,. 43. 

168 
ceiling of the dug out, her quiet, pleading voice reverberated, .Zvezda. 
Zvezda. Zvezda. Zvezda. ).335 
Katia‘s love for Travkin inspires her to neglect her own personal needs. Her sleepdeprived 
mind conjures up the image of her beloved: ..... . ........... ..... 
.... ......... . ... ...... ...... .. .......... .....-.. ........ ..., 
......., .........336 .Half-asleep, Katia held the receiver to her ear all day. In 
some kind of strange dreams, it seemed as though she saw Travkin.. Her love for 
Travkin leads her to wait for him after all others have given up hope of connection: 
.., ...... ....... . ......... ........, ... ...... ..... ... .. ...., . 
... ...... . ..... .. .... ..... ..... . ......, .... .. ........ 
............. (.And full of hope and unyielding perseverance, she waited. No one 
else still waited, but she waited. And no one dared to take the transmitter with the 
receiver, so as not to prompt an attack.).337 Her spontaneous waiting, driven by her 
selfless and one-sided dedication to Travkin, defines her entire personality. She 
needs no other motivation. 
Two films were based on this novella, attesting to its popularity even in the 
post-Soviet period. Aleksandr Ivanov‘s 1949 film version of The Star feminizes 
Katia to still a greater extent, dressing her in a skirted uniform. Ivanov‘s Katia wears 
her hair long and wavy, unlike Kazakevich‘s Katia, who has a short man‘s haircut. 
The music shows us that Katia falls in love with Travkin upon meeting him. She 
exists in the film only in relation to Travkin and disappears for long stretches of time 
335 Ibid., 82. 
336 Ibid., 86. 
337 Ibid., 87. 

169 
as the film follows the men scouting behind German lines. The director emphasizes 
Katia‘s role as a soldatka, a woman waiting for her man, in one scene toward the end 
of the film, other radio operators read letters from loved ones while Katia stands 
waiting in a doorway, bathed in moonlight, watching a shooting star falling toward 
the earth, .zvezda. returning to .zemlia.. Just before German planes bomb 
Travkin‘s scout group, Travkin makes contact with Katia on the radio, reconnecting 
with the hearth one last time. 
Nikolai Lebedev‘s 2002 version of The Star emphasizes Katia‘s .feminine. 
weakness and need for men during the introduction of her character. She wakes up 
during a bombing on her first day at the front. Scared, she runs out of her cabin, only 
to be rescued by a man. He holds her to the ground, protecting her, and then helps 
her to her feet. He tells her that she is beautiful, drawing the viewer‘s attention to 
her body from her very introduction. In contrast, when the viewer meets the men 
who join Travkin‘s scout groups, the director introduces them through their 
individual skills, for example, one is an excellent shot, while another soldier speaks 
German. Lebedev transforms Katia‘s and Travkin‘s relationship from an unrequited 
love into a reciprocal longing for each other. When they first meet each other, both 
characters clearly are attracted to each other. As in Ivanov‘s film, Katia disappears 
for much of the film, only to reappear whenever Travkin is able to connect to camp. 
After a long break in communication, Katia weeps at hearing Travkin‘s voice. She 
conveys his important message about German troop movement, which eventually 
leads to the liberation of Poland. All members of Travkin‘s group die without 

170 
information, but are decorated posthumously. Katia‘s love for Travkin is so strong 
that she never marries. She returns to her small town and becomes a history teacher, 
nurturing school children as she would have nurtured Travkin‘s and her children, had 
the war not thwarted their love. 
Katia is the quintessential warrior-handmaiden. She is beautiful, kind, 
nurturing—in short, traditionally feminine. She sees herself only in relation to 
Travkin and values herself less than him. While the men in her detachment use their 
last names, Katia remains Katia, a form of address which emphasized her diminutive, 
but affectionate, status among the other soldiers. In all versions of the story, she 
waits for her beloved soldier to come home, even after his death. 
In his epic novel The Storm (...., 1948), Il‘ia Erenburg also includes an 
image of eternal faithfulness and devotion in the figure of Natasha in his epic novel 
Buria (1948). Erenburg includes a variety of women in his epic novel in an attempt 
to represent the breadth of the entire Soviet war effort, the rear and the front.338 
Natasha is the principal female character. The novel concludes with the joyful 
reunion of Natasha and her husband, Vasia. Their small family functions as a 
microcosm of the Soviet experience. Natasha clearly symbolizes the .Homeland- 
Mother. (Rodina-Mat). Her fate and the fate of the Rodina-Mat. are intertwined. 
Erenburg writes: .. ......... ......, . ....... ... .... ........ .. ...., 
......-...... ........, ..... ..... ...., ......, .. ..... .........: ...... 
......... . .. ..., ...... ....., ......, ..... (.And little Natasha, on whose 
338 He writes about nurses, snipers, and reconnaissance scouts. 

171 
face everything was written, just having learned the meaning of life, could not move: 
on to her shoulders fell the destiny of people, Russian, the world.).339 Natasha, a 
botany student, and her beloved, Vasia, an architect, recently married and living in 
Minsk, are separated when the Nazis attack the Soviet Union. After the invasion, 
Natasha feels a patriotic need to .do something,. and initially keeps watch on 
rooftops.340 Natasha‘s initial reaction to the war sets Erenburg apart from most 
postwar male novelists: ...... ... ......... .. ....., .. ......... ......... 
......: ..... ...... ............ ..... .. .. .... ......., . ...... 
....... .......—... ..... . ... ....! ...... ........... .... ........: . . 
...... (.When she returned to the roof, she was met with joyful news: they had 
destroyed four planes. She was not scared at night. Rather the thunder of missiles 
pleased her: =what power we have!‘ Natasha felt like a soldier: =And I am at 
war‘.).341 Not only does Natasha take pleasure in Soviet military might, something 
one would find sooner in the memoirs of a woman pilot, but she has a clearly 
developed self-image. She identifies herself by occupation and Komsomol 
affiliation, as well as by her relationship to a man: ..? .. .......... ........... 
.—.... .o........ (.=I? I‘m a student. A Komosomol member. I am a 
commander‘s wife‘.).342 At this moment, in the midst of bombing, she sees herself 
as a soldier, helping defend the nation.

Throughout the novel, Nazi brutality infuriates Natasha and makes her long 
for revenge: 
..... ......... .....: ......., ....... .......... .......! ... .

(Then she got up angrily: .scoundrel, killing unarmed citizens! ... And I 
cannot do anything. I stand and I watch these terrible things ..Now the 
houses next to the factories were burning. Vasia is over there!. Natasha no 
longer felt fear, did not feel anything other than fury: it pounded in her 
temples and made it hard for her to take a breath. If only one could hit them! 
... And when one of the bombers caught fire, Natasha cried in rage: .We got 
it! got it!. Other planes continued to bomb the city).343 
Natasha is enraged at the destruction of the family of her friend Klava. When 
Klava‘s pilot husband does not return from a mission it enrages Natasha: ...... 
...... ............ .. ....., . ... ..... .... ..... . .......: ........! 
.., ... ........! .... .. .... ......!. (.When Natasha returned from 
Klava's, her eyes were dry and hard: =I hate them! Oh, how I hate them! If only I 
could make mines!‘. )344 Senseless violence develops hatred in a family-minded 
woman. After seeing corpses, Natasha demands to go to the front and is accepted as 
a nurse. 
Although in the midst of bombing, female soldiers in male-authored works 
usually require comforting and assurance from their male peers, Natasha stands 
alone, fearless on the roof. Unlike most women in male-authored works, she rarely 
343 Ibid., 202. 
344 Ibid., 328. 

173 
cries. Despite these points of divergence from the handmaiden model, Natasha 
remains an ideal female nurturer in a male-authored story. Like Tolstoy‘s Natasha in 
War and Peace, Erenburg‘s Natasha matures into an adult during the action of the 
novel and will help produce the next generation after the war. She simultaneously 
fulfills several roles, all of them traditionally feminine: kind nurse, patient, straw 
widow, dutiful daughter, and nurturing mother. She represents the family. The 
narrator introduces her at a wedding party and the reader sees her in a family 
situation at the end of the novel. She is always among relatives. She cares for her 
dying mother and worries about her mourning father. Even her botany studies 
indicate a dedication to living things. She nurturers her plants prior to the war, and 
nurses the wounded while caring for her family during the war. 
After three weeks as a combat nurse on the front, Natasha discovers that she 
is pregnant. Pregnancy on the front is treated with relative frequency in the works of 
male authors. Often the pregnant soldier wants to remain at the front, almost always 
leading to tragic sacrifice and death. Natasha, in contrast, makes the .acceptable. 
choice, as the author wants the reader to do, realizing that motherhood and warfare 
are .incompatible.. She returns to Moscow and nurses wounded soldiers until the 
end of the war. In the midst of the war, Natasha wonders at the promise of a new 
life: .... . .......... ....... .. .... .....: ... ......., ... ...... ..... 
...... .......! .... ... ...-.. ..... ......, ...... ... . ...... . ..... ..., 
..... ... ............ ...... ....... .. ..... .. . ... .......... ..... 
..... ... ... .. .. ......, .. .. ....... (.With amazement, she looked at her 

174 
stomach: how strange that she could have a child now! Such a peaceful, eternal thing 
... and now, there was no life, war had overturned everything. However, nature does 
not take anything into consideration. Soon it will be spring ... nothing to do with 
nature or the heart)..345 Like Tolstoy‘s Natasha, Erenburg‘s Natasha is a lifeaffirming 
character in the midst of the destruction of war. 
Although separated, Natasha and Vasia are always in each other‘s thoughts. 
Like all handmaidens, Natasha remains forever faithful to Vasia. She loves him 
living or dead: .O.. ....., ... .... ....., .. ...... .. .. ....., . ..........., 
. ..... ... .... ..........: ..... .. ... ...... ...., .... ...?. (.She 
knew that Vasia had died, but her love did not die; rather it ignited again when she 
asked herself: could she love someone who no longer exists?.)346 She longs for him 
and needs him throughout the war. In works written by male authors, women and 
the thoughts of women often comfort men during battle. Vasia is no exception: 
Erenburg describes how the very idea of Natasha affects him during his partisan 
service:

(Natasha never left Vasia‘s side—she was not an apparition as she had been 
in the Belorusian forests,--but alive, warm: he saw how she blew on hot tea, 
jokingly pursing her lips, how she drew plants, tilting her head to one side, 
walking along Gorky Street in a little blue beret, her eyes laughing and her 
curious nose lifted upwards. When would he hug her? He patiently waited 
almost four years, and now had come the end).347 
(Vasia cried .fire,. and in front of him amidst the smoke and flames, in a 
rosy-gray dawn (as if blood had mixed with the haze), stood sweet, snubnosed 
Natasha).348 
Upon their reunion, he tells her: .=. ..... ...., ..... .. ... . ........., 
............ . ...... . ... ........... ... ....... .. .... ..... ....... 
..........—.... ....... . ...... . ... ... ... . .. ..., . .. ...... ... . 
..... ...... ........‘. (.I wrote you, when you were encircled, I spoke with 
you. I felt it. Because of that, we recognize each other. When we parted, we were 
children. Now we have a son ... I‘m not who I was and you are different ... but I love 
you more than ever.).349 and . =. .. ... ......., ..... . .... ...., ......‘. 
(.=And, Natasha, I dreamt of you when we were in the forest‘.).350 Their love never 
diminishes, and Erenburg‘s novel finishes in Moscow on May 9, 1945, with their 
happy reunion. 
Although The Storm includes women participating in the war effort in various 
capacities, Natasha, the most traditional female character, remains central to 
Erenburg‘s novel. She survives the war, choosing a noncombat wartime occupation 
and putting her pregnancy before service at the front. The happy family portrait with 
which Erenburg leaves the reader mirrors the images in media at the time of writing.

In general, Soviet writers stopped writing about the Great Patriotic War 
during the 1950s, returning to the topic in the 1960s. Among the first in the Thaw 
period was Vasilii Grossman‘s epic novel Life and Fate (..... . ......, 1960). 
Although the novel revolves around a woman, Liudmila Nikolaevna Shaposhnikova, 
woman warriors are almost entirely absent from the novel. Grossman mentions five 
women soldiers in his narrative. He begins the novel with captured army doctor, 
Sofia Osipovna Levinton, an elderly woman, stripped of her military insignia, who 
dies in a gas chamber. He also describes two uniformed female soldiers, but only 
shows them playing cards and mentions their relationships to male commanding 
officers.351 Katia Vengrova is the only female soldier who appears in more than one 
or two scenes in the narrative. He includes an episode in which a male soldier is 
wrongly prosecuted for rape of a female comrade due to an unfounded rumor about 
an armed, forced encounter with his beloved, Lida Voinovaia, a radio operator. 
Grossman develops a subplot around one female soldier, Katia. Like 
Kazakevich‘s Katia, Grossman‘s Katia is a radio operator. She functions in the plot 
as the lover of Shaposhnikova‘s son Serezha. The male soldiers discuss her physical 
appearance at length, reducing her to a sum of body parts, in an attempt to disguise 
their attraction to her: ........, ... ..... ........ . ..... ...... ......, 
..... . ..... ....... .... ......., ... . ......., .....—...... ..... 
......., ... . ....... ..... ... .....?. (.=Of course, under these conditions, 
she'll do, since there's nothing else. She has long legs like a crane and doesn't have a

behind. She has big eyes like a cow. What kind of girl is that?‘.)352 Serezha and 
Katia fall in love and sleep together. When Serezha is sent off to regimental 
headquarters, their commanding officer orders him to take Katia: .. ..... ...... 
........, ... .. ... ...... ... ..........., ........ .. .. ..... ...... 
(.The radio operator will go with you as there is nothing for her to do without a 
transmitter. Take her to the regimental headquarters. ).353 Katia and Serezha are 
thrilled and Katia exits the narrative at this moment, when she leaves the front. She 
is content to follow her beloved and leave the front. She is beautiful, sweet, often 
scared, and needs Serezha. At a certain point, Katia falls in love with Serezha to the 
extent that she is prepared to sacrifice everything in order for him to live: .... 
........, ... ... . ..... ......, .... .. ....... ........... ...... 
(.She thought that she would give up everything in life just to see Shaposhnikov 
alive.).354 In short, Katia acts as a true handmaiden. Her personal feelings and love 
for Serezha motivate her far more than the war. All of the women in Grossman‘s 
epic, with the exception of the elderly army doctor, function as handmaidens, as 
objects of male desire. The reader never sees any of these women engaging in 
official military business. 
While criticized by Soviet critics for his negative portrayal of Soviet military 
leaders as cowardly, self-serving, and indifferent to subordinates, Vasil Bykov 
(1924-2003) remains a widely read author, due to his sensitive depictions of male

353 Ibid., 316. 
354 Ibid., 314. 

178 
soldiers, their psychological states, and brave, selfless actions. While he portrays 
Soviet male soldiers complexly and positively, his female characters fall into 
traditional secondary roles of sexualized handmaiden or maternal nurturer. 
.The Third Missile. (1961) is the first of Bykov‘s novellas to feature a 
female soldier. In the novella, an antitank crew of six men and one female medic, 
Liusia, perish destroying enemy tanks and infantry. Like many of Bykov‘s novellas, 
the story is narrated years in the future by a male veteran, in this case, Lozniak, is the 
lone survivor of the decisive tank battle. This technique requires that we see women 
characters solely through the male gaze. 
Liusia is one of the most active and positive female characters in Bykov‘s 
oeuvre. Bykov contrasts her heroic deeds with those of a cowardly male soldier, who 
survives the war. The narrator attributes Liusia‘s strength and her sense of justice not 
to her own character, but to her pedigree: her father was a Civil War hero, wounded 
eighteen times before his early death. Raised by strangers, she is a .good girl,. kind 
to everyone:

(She went with Leshka. You could see that she had a good with him, 
otherwise she would not have laughed so roguishly and happily. This laugh 
thrust incomprehensible pain into my soul. But I know: Liusia was a very 
good girl. She was so attentive, delicate and loving with all—acquaintances 
and strangers, young and old.)355 
355 ....., ....... ......,. 212.

Throughout the novel, the narrator describes Liusia‘s effect on himself and the other 
men. She enlivens them, bringing life into their quarters: ......., ......... 
........, ..... ...... ....., .... ...... .......... ..... ......., ...... 
..... ...... ..... ........... (.Stepping lightly and as soundlessly as a night 
bird, Liusia would soon appear near the front line, crossing the trench. The guys 
would suddenly feel uplifted.).356 Many of the men, including the narrator, fall in 
love with her. The narrator remembers her emotional warmth in the midst of a 
hopeless battle: .... ..... ....., ..... ........ . ..... ....... .. ... .. 
...-.. . ....... .... ........ ......., . . ....—... .. ..... . ........ 
.. ..., .... . .. ...., ..... .. ......., ...... ......... ...... ...

But joy warms the depth of my soul, and I know: it‘s from Liusia. I feel her here, 
even if I don‘t see her. I hear her breathing, her every movement. Only God knows 
if we can protect her.).357 His affection for her leads prompts the same reaction 
many male soldiers have toward female soldiers, a desire to defend and protect these 
women: ... ..... ........ ...... .... .... ........... ..... .........

for her rose from the very depth of my soul. Something warm, beyond friendly, but 
brotherly flows into my heart. I so wanted to protect her, to defend her, to not let her

be injured.).358 As the narrator‘s situation becomes more desperate, his feelings for 
Liusia intensify: ......, ....... ........!-....... ....... ....—. ..... 
....! .....! ........! ...... ... ..... .. ........, ..... ....... ., ... 
..... . .... ...... .... .. .......... .......... ... .. ... ... ....?. 
(.=My dear, kind girl!‘ I want to say. =I love you! I love you! Forever and ever ... If 
we are going to die, if I fall, then I will still love you to my last moment. How can I 
be without you?‘.)359 For Lozniak, Liusia represents life, tenderness, joy, the 
antithesis of combat. He emotionally clings to her during the most difficult moments 
of war. 
Lozniak is impressed by Liusia‘s beauty from his first meeting with her. As a 
typical handmaiden, she is physically attractive, small, and rather childlike, inviting 
protection:

(She was a simple, blue-eyed, surprisingly social, and an all-together 
beautiful young woman. Short, energetic, with the appearance of a sixteen 
year old girl, she carried herself as if she did not know that she was 
absolutely lovely. We all so respected her: the soldiers, commanders, the 
young and the older ones. As if in rivalry, we tried to make her life on the 
front a little better, a little more pleasant).360

181 
He also remembers her serious expression. Although comforting, Liusia‘s presence 
is somewhat divisive. She unintentionally makes the narrator hate his comrade 
Leshka, when Leshka appears to have more success talking to Liusia. 
In .The Third Missile,. one finds one of the rare instances in which a 
handmaiden uses a weapon, the only such instance in Bykov‘s oeuvre. We do not 
see her shooting, but the narrator picks up a weapon, recently used by Liusia: .. 
....... . ........ . ....... . ... ............ .... ..... ... 
.........., ..... ..... .. ........ . ...... .. .....—........ ..., ... 
.. .. ......—... ... ........, . .. . ....... . ..... .... .. ........ ..... 
. ....... ...., ....... . ... ... ...., .. .......—.... ....... (.I crawl 
from the landing to the shelter and stand up straight there. Liusia sits above 
Luk‘ianov, with her tommy gun lying next to her. I take it by the jacket—it‘s hot. 
No, not from the sun, but because she had been shooting, but in the thunder of the 
battle, we had not noticed. I take the cartridge drum. There are still bullets in it, but 
only a few—the drum was light.).361 She also helps the narrator fire at the enemy 
when they are surrounded and outnumbered. She fights physically only because she 
is one of two soldiers left to aid Lozniak, soon returning to her nursing duties. 
Regardless of her active fighting, the narrator makes it clear that only 
necessity led Liusia to handle a weapon. She is a nurturer by nature and continues to 
tend to the wounded even during battle: ..... ....., ... ......, ........... 
... .........., ........ .. ..... (.Liusia was sitting, like she sat leaning 
361 Ibid., 261. 

182 
above Luk‘ianov, supporting herself with her hand.).362 Although Liusia is 
primarily an object of male desire, sexually attractive to her comrades, she also 
fulfills the role of a mother to the dying men, treating them as a mother would treat 
children: ......... ...... .............—.... .....,--..... ......., 
.......... ..... (.=Be quiet. You can‘t talk or you‘ll be worse,‘ explains to him, 
as if he were a child.).363 Her nurturing actions show the reader that she would be a 
loving mother. 
Liusia dies in battle taking care of a wounded soldier: she crawls under fire 
to a dead German to retrieve a canteen of water, since her dying comrade Luk‘iankov 
had been begging for water. On the way back to their trench, she is shot.

(Liusia is already closer. She is crawling to the first earth mounds of the 
trench. Meeting our frightened glances, she smiles encouragingly. It is her 
smile, it seems, that turns everything over in me. I want to cry from tension 
and fear for her. But Liusia is already crawling onto the sole surviving 
breastwork. Krivenok, not considering danger, stands up at full height and 
reaches out for her. She extends her hands toward him, gets up on her 
knees...and falls. 
Through tears, I cast a glance at Liusia. She is silent and with powerless 
obedience lies down on the breastwork).365

The narrator is both traumatized by the death of a woman he loves and struck by 
Liusia‘s bravery, especially in comparison to another soldier‘s cowardly, selfpreserving 
actions. 
In Bykov‘s 1964 novella .The Dead Feel No Pain. (....... .. ......), 
one finds a fine example of a handmaiden behaving like a mother. Not beautiful, 
Katia, a nurse, cannot function as an object of desire for the male soldiers, so the 
narrator focuses on her maternal, nurturing qualities. As previously discussed, she 
cooks for the soldiers and is invigorated by kitchen work. She comforts the 
wounded with her presence, treats her charges like children, scolding and 
commanding them, constantly binding their wounds. Katia calls the wounded 
narrator .my dear little one. (milen.kii), as she tells him to bear his pain.366 She 
gives life to the soldiers by leading them to safety through a minefield through her 
chain of steps to salvation. She leads the injured to safety, while bleeding to death 
after stepping on a mine. 
In .The Pack of Wolves. (...... ...., 1975), the reader sees a female 
soldier Klava through the eyes of Levchuk, the narrator, as he sits in a courtyard 
awaiting a former comrade-in-arms thirty years after the war and remembers an 
unsuccessful rescue mission into a forest. Although she is officially a radio operator, 
she functions in the narrative primarily as the previous object of the narrator‘s 
affections: ... . ... ............ ....., ..... ...... ........ .. .. ....... 
.......... . ... ...... ........ .. ...., .. .. ....... ...... ..... ... .. 
366 Ibid., 304, 305. 

184 
.............. (.Yes and it was Klava...there had been a time when Levchuk had 
considered it happiness to walk an extra kilometer with her in the forest, but not now. 
Now, Klava did not interest him.).367 Levchuk is the leader of their group. Klava is 
always secondary to him, both in terms of their actions and her place within the 
narrative. 
At the time of their last mission together, Levchuk is unsure about his 
feelings for Klava. He finds her beautiful, but her possible relations with other men 
diminish his feelings and lead the reader to question Klava‘s morality.

(Levchuk himself did not know if he loved Klava. Maybe he just liked her a 
bit, but he did not show it at all because he did not want to cross into 
Platonov‘s territory. Even on the first day, when he led her from Kirovskaia, 
from the first glance between their new radio operator and the commander of 
the headquarters, he understood that it would end up simply like that: they 
matched each other perfectly.)368 
Levchuk cannot help but be enchanted by Klava as her physical appearance 
impresses all she meets. Regardless of the hardships of war, Klava always looks 
beautiful, wears clothing that fits her and shows off her small, feminine frame.

(But then, from first sight, the radio operator enchanted all. She was so 
graceful in her new, white jacket and her tiny, little felt boots, sweetly 
scraping the morning frost; she went about in a lamb's wool hat, which was 
coquettishly fastened at the back of her head. Light-colored bangs covered 
her forehead, but on her little hands, she wore little, fur gloves and a lace 
collar).369 
When Klava is not crying from shame due to her substandard military performance 
or frustration from physical demands, she laughs nonstop and loves everything. This 
laughing, combined with her rosy cheeks, gives the narrator a childish impression of 
her. He and the other men try to persuade her to leave their company, to return home 
to her mother, in order to protect her and save her life. Clearly, they know best, but 
her stubborn, childlike refusal to leave results in her death: .-.. ..... .. .. 
..... ...... .... (.=I‘m not going. I‘m not going anywhere‘.).370 The narrator 
reminisces: ...... ..... .. . ..... ........ . ..... . .....-...... 
....... ..... (.It would have been better for Klava to have gone to some village. 
To her grandmother, to some experienced old lady.).371 
Bykov believes Klava, and by extension all women, should stay away from 
combat. Her presence on the front only hinders the male soldiers in their work. As 
previously noted in typology early in the novella, she sleeps through her nightshift 
and then cries in shame, but her incompetence interferes with military business when 
she cannot keep up with her male comrades. They must wait for her while she 
369 Ibid., 33. 
370 Ibid., 18. 
371 Ibid., 19. 

186 
rests.372 They slow down so she can keep up: .... .. ....., ..... .. ........ 
..... ........, ..... . ......... ........, ...... ....., .. ....... ...... 
....... .. ...... ........ (.Not hurrying so that they not leave the radio 
operator behind, they descended from the pine knoll, skirted the ravine, beyond 
which they soon came upon to the forest path.).373 Klava should be a mother, rather 
than a soldier. Bykov shows her maternal potential when Klava comforts a child by 
hugging him.374 This scene precedes her death in combat, showing the tragedy of a 
situation in which women are killed before realizing what Bykov believes is their 
true potential as mothers. Klava contributes nothing to the war effort in this novella, 
and her presence serves only to show Bykov‘s view that women are meant to raise 
families. 
Bykov continues to explore the incompatibility of maternity and warfare in 
his story .His Battalion. (... ........, 1976). In this novella, paternal, protective 
commanding officers try to send a pregnant medic, Vera Veretennikova, to the rear 
before the start of a serious battle. Veretennikova‘s reluctance to transfer, regardless 
of policies and orders, results in her death, and by extension, the death of her unborn 
child. 
Vera‘s situation leads to various discussions which reveal the attitudes of 
male soldiers toward women soldiers. Upon the demise of Vera‘s lover, an officer, 
Markin, decides to replace the deceased with Vera, out of desperation:

(.I know. Vera will command the seventh.. 
.You found a commander!. 
.So what? She‘s a sharp girl..... 
.Sharp, yes, and pregnant. Did you think of that?. 
.So what if she‘s pregnant? No one kept her here. She decided herself to 
stay. 
That‘s how it is.).375 
The men are obviously uncomfortable with the idea of a pregnant woman 
commanding a company, but simply have no other options. Markin‘s interlocutor, 
Voloshin, angrily insists that her place was behind the front and that nothing good 
would come from Vera being in combat: .. ...-.... .... ......., ....... 
....... .. ........ ...., ... .... . ......... .. ...... .. .., .. ... ..... 
.. ..... .... .. ............ . ...... ...... ....., ......., ..... ... 
....., .......... ....... ......, ...... ........ .. .. ...... (.It was 
altogether annoying, but most importantly, there was no place for Vera in the 
battalion. No place before nor during this unsuccessful attack that promises nothing 
but another incidental death. All the more at this time, at the beginning of an attack, 
which assured her of an absolutely ridiculous death and promised nothing good.).376 
This decision to assign the 7th company to Vera supports the deep-seated assumption 
375 ....., .... ........,. ........ ........., Vol. 2, 271. 
376 Ibid., 272. 

188 
that Russian women may be able to fight, but for everyone‘s own good, women 
should do so only in the most desperate situations. 
Rather than feminizing women soldiers and focusing on their nurturing or 
sexually desirable characteristics, some male authors verbally attack the soldiers, 
portraying them as incompetent. They transform armed women into negative 
characters, dysfunctional or .unnatural. as women. In the 1970s, Bykov focused 
more on women soldiers‘ incompetence in battle than he did in his earlier works. As 
noted above, Klava, the only female solider in .The Pack of Wolves. is beautiful and 
nurturing, but is incapable of performing adequately in combat. Vera is so 
incompetent, that she dies not from a bullet or a mine, but because she got caught up 
in barbed wire during combat: .-..,-...... ..........., ...... .....—..., .. 
......., ....... ..........—...... .......... (.=Well,‘ sighing heavily, 
said the fighter, =there she was lying on the barbed wire. She got caught: it was hard 
to extricate her‘.).377 His portrayal of the incompetent woman combatant reached an 
apex in his 1977 novella .To Go and Not Return. (...... . .. .........,. films 
1992 and 2007). The novella begins with the partisan Zos‘ka Nareiko‘s trek through 
the woods. From the first page, Zos‘ka appears incompetent and unsuitable for 
partisan duties. She dresses inappropriately for the winter weather in a skirt, falls 
into a river, and gets lost. She is rescued by the partisan, Anton, who follows her to 
ensure her safety. Partisan leaders do not trust Zos‘ka with a weapon: ....... . 
... .. .... ........, .... ...... ..... ....... ..... .... ......... . 
377 Ibid., 299. 

189 
....., .., ..... ... ......... .. .. ........., ... ........ .............— 
. .. .... ..... ........ ... ....... ....... .. .... .. ..... (.She did not 
have any kind of weapon, even though she could have asked one of the guys for a 
weapon before leaving. But when she hinted about it to Dozortsev, he forbade it 
categorically—it was better in her work without a weapon. Nor did they give her a 
compass.).378 Anton views her alternately as both a child ..... .. .......!— 
........ .. ....., ...... .. . ......... ....... ......... (.=What a child 
you are!‘ switching into a whisper, he said with noticeable tenderness.)379 and a 
sexual object, culminating in a sexual encounter that approaches rape. 
Interestingly, Anton, although resourceful, proves to be less than an ideal 
partisan himself. Shortly after their sexual encounter, Zos‘ka and Anton have an 
argument after his decision to desert. Both are captured by Red Army soldiers and 
accuse each other of being deserters. Zos‘ka saves Anton‘s life by convincing their 
captors that their accusations are the result of a lovers‘ quarrel, but she stupidly 
threatens to tell the village inhabitants everything that happened between them, so he 
shoots her. She crawls back to the village alone, proving her resolve and toughness, 
regardless of her clumsiness as a partisan. 
We find an interesting progression in Bykov‘s oeuvre. Women soldiers 
occupy prominent roles in five of his war stories. There is a definite trend from 
positive portrayals of brave women soldiers in the 1960s to more negative portrayals 
as he continues to write into the 1970s. Liusia, the first woman warrior to appear in 
378 ....., ...... . .. .........,. Vol. 3, 209. 
379 Ibid., 220. 

190 
Bykov‘s work even participates in battle. Although Katia is not physically attractive, 
she is a nurturer. Both women sacrifice their lives in order to save the lives of male 
soldiers. In contrast, Klava, although a nurturer, is represented as a burden for the 
men who must wait for her to catch up with them. Veretennikova, although brave, is 
argumentative, quarrelsome, and disrespectful of authority. Her refusal to transfer to 
the rear results in her senseless death. Finally, the partisan Zos‘ka is the most 
negative, cowardly, and incompetent of all of Bykov‘s women characters. 
Throughout his writing career, it seems as though Bykov rethought the role of 
women in war and relegated them from traditionally feminine complements to male 
soldiers to merely negative roles. While the first women help and nurture men, the 
second group hinders male soldiers and, thus, the military effort. Bykov seems to 
have concluded that the presense of women will only cause distraction, therefore 
they have no place in the war effort whatsoever. 
In his novella about a women‘s antiaircraft battery .Stepan Bukov. 
(....... .....,. 1969), Vadim Kozhevnikov (1909-84) disarms women in combat 
in various ways. His women characters are arrogant, argumentative haters of life on 
the battlefield. Much of the novella is told through a male gaze, from the point of 
view of a male veteran who interacted with the women antiaircraft gunners prior to 
the bombing of their battery. Bukov, the narrator, relates his memories to the 
younger generation, long after the war has concluded, in the years when the woman‘s 
role in the military and her right to serve has been denied. 

191 
From the introduction of the female fighters, Bukov makes clear a gender 
based dichotomy. Men fighters can be soldiers, but women in combat remain merely 
girls. ............ .........—. ..... ....., ..........—. ......... 
........, ... ....... ........... (.The commander of these girls-commanded

..... .......... (.When they kill us, men soldiers, well, it happens. But when 
they kill girls, women, then it takes superhuman strength to bear it.).381 A man may 
be a soldier, but a girl is just capable of being a woman. Bukov uses feminine, 
diminuitive suffixes at every opportunity, for example, leitenanka and politrushka. 
A woman warrior is treated as an .unnatural. construction: .=......

for the Motherland is most important. There‘s no time for personal love. The Soviet

battery‘s political instructor immediately after crushing a flower below her boot. 382 
This woman not only takes lives when she shoots down planes, but shows hateful 
disdain for the living when she destroys a symbol of beauty and life. From women‘s

192 
memoirs, we know that women serving in the military did not feel the need to reject 
femininity. They stress their love for flowers. 
The narrators, both Bukov and the omniscient narrators pay greater attention 
to women‘s physical appearances than they do to men‘s. Bukov describes the 
leitenanka, the female lieutenant commander of the women‘s battery in negative 
terms. He would likely describe a male commander as .experienced,. and does not 
describe the hair of any of the male characters. By focusing on the lieutenant‘s dyed 
hair, he emphasizes her age and artificiality. 
Kozhevnikov casts his female characters using the usual stereotypes, 
nurturing women who are most concerned with tending to their appearances, finding 
husbands and having babies. The women soldiers are less concerned with weaponry 
or military strategy. Even though the political instructor hypocritically chastises 
Bukov for bringing the women flowers and the women for interest in male soldiers, 
she paints her lips specifially to attract the attention of tank operators: ... .. ... 
......., ....., ... ...... ..... ..............? ..... ........ .. ...

...... . ....... .......... . ... .......... .... .... .......... ... ... 
....... (.But do you think that she was always that principled? When the tankists 
would return to us to retrieve the repaired tanks, the women‘s battery would be there 
to meet them with honor. And this political instructor would paint her lips especially 
for them..)383 After the bombing, the political instructor, Zoia, cries, holding her

is sitting with closed eyes and rocking. Then she opened her eyes, such, you know, 
blurry ones, as if looking right through me. She speaks in a tired voice: =I cannot 
bathe a child with one hand‘.).384 Women warriors also describe obvious distress 
upon wounding, but they were most often concerned with returning to the front and 
their comrades-in-arms as fast as possible. Zoia‘s friend Liuda understands why, 
upon demobilization, Zoia takes up with another veteran as fast as possible: .. ... 
.... ...... .......... . ...-......, ... ...... .......... . ........-

herself wanted to worry about someone, as she had always worried about the women 
antiaircraft gunners, and because of this, all thought Karonina was older, but not only 
because of rank. Karonina talked about love with the girls, as if it were a 
disciplinary offence, as if love were a destruction of military regulations.).385 
Throughout the novella, Kozhevnikov drives home the message that women 
do not belong in combat. When bombed, the women move around in a gaze, shell-

194 
shocked. The horrors of war and the sight of dead comrades overwhelm them.386 
The two significant women soldiers are both maimed in combat. 
Interestingly, Kozhevnikov believes that there is no solidarity among women. 
Women gunners, at least in .Stepan Bukov,. look down upon radio operators. At 
one point, the gunner Liuda chastises another veteran, whom she accuses of flirting: 
.=........ ... .. ..........., . . ... .. .......... . .......... .......‘. 
(.=You got used to getting it on with radio operators, but I‘m not a radio operator. I 
served in the artillery‘.).387 Radio operators, in Liuda‘s estimation, are more 
sexually free.

(.And I have to announce to you guys: our brother of the male persuasion is 
worse than an animal if he does not see in a woman the highest human 
characteristics, but a woman has such high human characteristics. They are 
capable of much more than we are. Do you know how they were, our female 
anti-aircraft gunners. For example, they shot and worked their way out 
during the raid, rubbing off blood, dressing their wounds. Then they would 
ask Guliaev: .Perhaps your soldiers need to do some laundry? We have only 
one weapon left, so we can do everyone‘s laundry.).388

At the first opportunity, the women in the antiaircraft battery eagerly drop their 
weapons to engage in housekeeping tasks. Bukov values these soldiers for their 
traditional abilities and their desire to do homemaking tasks for male soldiers, rather 
than their combat skills. 
In contrast, Bukov appreciates women because of their maternal natures. 
While he discounts armed women, he considers mothers to be heroic:

(All his life Bukov had stood in awe of women and it was not simply because 
there had been a lot of men but few women at the front. 
As he marched across the liberated countryside which had been 
devastated by the fascists, he saw silent heroic women huddling with their 
children by makeshift stoves in ramshackle huts. 
Bukov was convinced that Soviet soldiers were deeply indebted to 
their mothers and wives for being provided with everything at the front. He 
could not stand small talk about women and used to say to Nikolai Churkin, 
.As for the equality of the sexes ...Well, first we‘ve got to put right historic 
injustices. As time goes by we must give women the special privileges they 
deserve for giving life to new people. It‘s they who bear them, after all. And 
the better we make life for them, the better people will become in the 
future.)390

196 
Although one cannot equate Bukov with Kozhevnikov, Kozhevnikov does portray 
Bukov as a positive character. Like the hero of Sholokhov‘s .One Man‘s Destiny,. 
Bukov is a Soviet everyman, representing the average Soviet veteran. 
Bukov‘s disgust with women warriors most likely has less to do with 
women‘s participation in combat than with the political instructor‘s reaction to him 
when he brings a flower to the women‘s battery. She commits a mortal sin: she 
mocks him and embarrasses him in front of others. He never forgets this 
transgression and when asked to contribute a bronze flower to a memorial of the 
women casualties, he refuses, remembering his smashed gift. This scene gives 
evidence of the primary reason why the makers of government policies and why 
male authors were so ready to eliminate women from combat spheres: they intruded 
on the man‘s world and threatened his right to prove himself before others. When 
women are introduced to the military, they must assert their status as warriors. 
When men approach these women and are rebuffed, they become confused. The 
rebuffed man feels humiliated and objects to the woman‘s right to intrude in his 
world. 
Although the (mostly male) literary establishment actively buttressed the 
nation‘s policies of demobilization and reclassified women soldiers as marriageminded 
helpmates, some of the women soldiers disagreed with the military and 
literary disarming of women. One veteran, Iuliia Drunina (1924-91), achieved fame 
and literary acclaim. 

197 
Throughout her literary career, veteran Drunina confronted male authors‘ 
tendency to disarm women soldiers and to discredit their military contribution to the 
war.391 First published in Znania in 1940, she wrote dozens of volumes of poetry, 
mostly on war themes, and became the only female veteran to achieve literary 
acclaim. From 1941 to 1945, she served as a medic, but saw herself and her sistersin-
arms as warriors. She describes how she became a warrior in .In the Recruiting 
Office. (.. .......,. 1953):

One ordinary fighter.

Across the horror of mined fields.)392 
One can find the image of the child who becomes a warrior to defend her country 
throughout Drunina‘s poetry, as she associated her youth and abrupt immersion into 
the adult world with her military service. Drunina‘s choice of the term .boets.

shows that she saw herself as a fighter, rather than a nurse. She emphasizes the 
danger of war by including images of booming cannons and mine fields. 
Drunina directly addresses male authors‘ clichés about female soldiers. The 
epigraph to this chapter shows her amusement with her culture‘s inaccurate rewriting 
of her military experience:

And in love stories, excuse me, written on the homefront. 
And occasionally in headquarters near the front. 
But it was different in the war 
Not in the third echelon, but under fire.)393 
In this poem, she describes the difficulties of service on the front, shows that there 
was no time nor place to alter soldiers‘ overcoats so they closely fit women‘s bodies. 
As in much of her work, she deromanticizes the military experience: ......

closely fitted soldier‘s greatcoats existed only in the movies: ..... .. ..........?

Like male authors, Drunina describes female comrades, but a women‘s gaze 
differs greatly from a man‘s gaze. Drunina‘s female comrades are brave soldiers, 
rather than objects of male desire. Like the women pilot memoirists, Drunina 
memorializes fallen comrades, focusing on their bravery and their sacrifice, rather 
than their physical appearances. In .Homeward. (......,.1945), . cavalry 
squadron drinks ... ........., ...... ......... (.For the radio operator, a brave

and covering her dead body. Throughout the poem, Drunina juxtaposes Zina‘s 
military uniform to her blonde braids. ...... ..... . ..... ....../

We kissed each other, cried and sang. 
We confronted the bayonets. And right at the beginning 
A girl in a darned overcoat 
Splayed her arms on the snow. 
Mama! Mama! I made it to the goal... 
But on the steppe, on the wolf‘s shore 
A girl in a darned overcoat 
Threw her hands on the snow. 
Drunina resurrects these fallen comrades, describing them as heroes, situating them 
in a combat situation. They are never the mere accessories, but people in their own 
right. 
She addresses the male gaze and male mockery in her poem .Two Evenings. (....

(We stood by the Moscow River, 
The warm wind rustled my dress. 
For some reason suddenly, out from under your hand 
You looked oddly at me 
How one occasionally looks as a stranger. 
You looked and smiled at me: 
=Now, what kind of a soldier would you make? 
How were you, really, in the war? 
You surely did not sleep on the snow 
With your tommy gun by your head? 
Understand, I simply cannot 
I cannot imagine you in soldiers‘ boots!...‘ 
And that evening, I imagined another: 
There were mortars and the snow was falling. 
And a loved one told me quietly, 
He looked a bit like you: 
.Here we lie freezing on the snow, 
As if we had not lived in cities... 
I cannot imagine you 
In high-heeled shoes).399 
She understands that some men cannot reconcile the image of a woman soldier with 
a woman in feminine clothing. The male gaze simplifies a woman and reduces her 
to her physical body. These men can only see her surface, not the person in the 
clothing. Like many Russians, the postwar suitor cannot imagine Drunina‘s narrator 
or women in military dress. She answers him with her memory of another man from 
another time, who could not imagine her in peace-time, high-heeled shoes. In her 
writing, Drunina shows the complexity of women soldiers who can be both soldiers 
and beautiful. 
399 ......., ........... ......, 74.

Drunina does not treat men as sexual objects, as some male authors represent 
women. Drunina does not deny romance or female soldiers‘ need for male soldiers. 
However, in Drunina‘s poems, the poetic voice needs men differently then women 
need men in male-authored works:

(We divide a minute‘s happiness between the two of us,

And your loving, breaking voice. 
We divide a minute‘s happiness between the two of us).400 
The poetic voice in Drunina‘s poems does not need a man to save her life, rather she 
wants a man for companionship. Supporting male comrades simply make their 
experiences more pleasant. In ... ........., . ....., .. ... .. ........,. 
Drunina shows a male soldier helping a female soldier in a completely different way

And if I fell without strength, you raised me up and said 
=What kind of soldier are you?‘ 
What a January! What an evil wind!

It‘s very hard for me to be alone).401 
Drunina does not need a man physically to save her life. Her comrade encourages 
her, lifts her up when she is exhausted, but he does not have to carry her. She can 
walk as well as the men can. 
In her writing Drunina explores her complex feelings toward military life and 
demobilization. Although she describes terrible events and laments the loss of 
beloved comrades, she also remembers aspects of the war fondly. In .Oh childhood! 
As usual, how I wanted.... (... .......! ..., ... ......., ........,. 1958), the 
narrator looks back upon the war as an equalizer that afforded her equality with men, 
something she had longed for as a child:

(Oh childhood! As usual, how I wanted 
To be equal to the boys in everything. 
But papa and mama did not value bravery: 
.You are a girl, you know!—they repeated to me. 
'You will break your neck, sitting on the roof, 
Take you knitting and sit at the table.' 
And I crawled from the roof, hating 
My feminine, weak, my beautiful sex. 
Oh childhood! We were both reprimanded. 
Reproaches from my mother and silence from my father… 
But our faces were scorched with the wind of a battle 
And the wind of the front scorched our hearts 
But you are a girl, they repeated at home 
When in that hard year, I said 
That I was going to the front as an enlisted soldier, 
answering the call from the recruiting office 
My fatherland settled our dispute 
Tell me, memory, was it only yesterday 
I went off with the boys from our yard 
To the smoky land of trenches? 
In that bitter, memorable summer, 
No one repeatedly talked about weakness to me. 
Thank you, Motherland,-for the happiness 
To be equal with your sons in battle.)402

205 
Like women soldiers before her, the poet values military service for providing 
freedom from the boredom of traditional women‘s work. Despite the adventures, 
freedom, and equality the war provides, Drunina‘s portrayal of the war is not a 
romanticized one:

(I have just come form the front line 
Wet, freezing and angry, 
Nobody is in the mud-hut dug-out 
And, of course, the stove had gone out. 
I am so tired - I cannot lift my hands, 
No energy for the firewood, I‘ll make myself warm under my overcoat. 
I laid down, but I hear that 
Shrapnel hits our trenches).403 
This poem emphasizes her exhaustion and the difficulties of war. At the same time, 
she loves her youth on the front and wishes her man would understand her feelings:

These conflicting emotions about her military service result in mixed feelings upon 
demobilization. She hates to bid farewell to the close friends she has made during 
her time in the service: ..... ........ ....... .... .......,/ ........ .......

Although many authors portray war as something alien to women‘s nature, 
Drunina realizes that despite the difficulty and cruelty of war, she learned a lot about 
life and qualities traditionally identified as feminine:

Surrounded by death, she learned compassion. 
In .I Remember: The platoon arose to the attack ready to fire, the native soil 
trembled:. (.. .....: ........ . ..... ....., ......... ..... ......,. 1960), 
Drunina discusses how alive the war makes her feel:

(I remember: the platoon arose to the attack ready to fire, the native soil

...I understand: in silence of a day in the rear, somewhere during formation,

And my hands did not say .no!. as if someone had tied them. 
And I thought: I was born in this world for moments like these).408 
These lines are juxtaposed with descriptions of experiences in the postwar period 
that also make her celebrate life: the birth of her daughter and then publication of her 
first book. Male authors often portray the war as something as a great misfortune for 
any woman participant. Drunina answers this tendency by showing that her military 
experience was one of the defining moments of her life. 
Unlike her male colleagues, Drunina portrays women soldiers as 
multidimensional characters with personal motivations for going to war. She uses 
aggressive words like .boets. that makes heroes of nurses as fighters. She writes of 
her personal motivation to take up arms: .. ...... .. ..... . ........ ....., 
/.. .......... .... . ...... . .........,. /...... ... ... ....., ... 
........, /.. ..... ......... (.I went from school into the dugout,/ From the 
Beautiful Lady to .mother- f…er. and .f… your mother./ Because I could not find a

..... ............ ........ (.As if in a song, they ordered me to the west,/ And

way.).410 Through the portrayal of women as complex individuals with a sense of 
themselves, Drunina deconstructs the handmaiden type. Although Drunina, like 
male authors, writes about nurses and telephone operators, her women warriors are 
far more than flat characters fulfilling the role of romantic leads and complements to 
male characters. 
Most male authors expressed the attitude, as early as 1943, that women are 
somehow worse in combat than their male counterparts. Their responses buttressed 
the state‘s postwar policy of demobilizing women and pushing them back into 
traditional nurturing, nonaggressive roles. Furthermore, these writers participate in 
the nation-wide demobilization of women by disarming them symbolically, though 
systematically. Even when authors do not explicitly describe taking weapons from 
women, they disarm the women soldiers implicitly by neglecting to mention 
weaponry in general, choosing instead to focus on .women‘s work. or romantic 
interests. We know that historically nurses and radio operators were issued rifles and 
pistols, but male authors usually choose to ignore that, focusing instead on their 
medical field bags (giving them the capacity to nurture) and transmitter radios 
(which connect men with the metaphorical hearth, their home bases). The second 
epigraph, taken from Bykov‘s .To Go and Not Return. illustrates this tendency. 
410 ....... "...... .... ......... .....," in ...... ......, 17. 

210 
Unlike her male comrades, the partisan scout Zos‘ka is not entrusted with a gun, not 
even a compass. Bykov even takes away her ability to guide and defend herself. 
Male authors employ various tactics in their works to support the postwar 
state policy that women have no place in combat. In addition to showing women‘s 
incompetence and re-asserting female, nonviolent nature, male writers often include 
characters who explicitly express the opinion that a woman has no place in war. In 
Kazakevich‘s novella.Heart of a Friend. (....... ......), an officer, Remizov, 
tells Anichka: .. .... ... ..... .... .... .......... .. .... ........ ...- 
..... .. .. ......... .. ...., .. ........ ..... .. ....., ....... ....... 
(.I was so nervous about you the whole time. It‘s altogether not good. Don‘t get 
mad at me, but girls have no place here, honestly..)411 
These works overwhelmingly supported the opinion that women were not 
welcome at the front, generally because men believed that a woman‘s physical 
ability and emotional personality hindered her performance in combat. These same 
literary works also show that the men themselves were the least equipped to deal 
with a woman‘s presence in his unit. Vera‘s unplanned pregnancy and her 
commanding officers‘ subsequent confusion in Bykov‘s .His Battalion. show that, 
although almost a million women soldiers served on the front following the massive 
militarization campaign, male soldiers well into the war remained confused by and 
uncomfortable with women‘s presence at the front.

(Returning to the dugout, battalion commander, speaking to no one in 
particular, half-audibly hurled .I didn‘t catch up,. and the general looked at 
him with barely hidden contempt. The commander awaited the angry 
reproaches, scolding, and apparently, would listen to them quietly, realizing 
that he was guilty. But when it would come to matters concerning military 
girls, he felt helpless. The logic of behavior, instilled in him from all his 
years of education from military service met an impasse, when he came up 
against the most banal girlish whim. However, like many in the war, he felt 
that the women were incompatible with the army, that the woman in the war 
was a misunderstanding.) 412 
Some works by male authors support the assumption that women should not be at 
war because they distract male soldiers. The mere presence of women in combat 
situations destroys the camaraderie among male soldiers that was so valued in the 
Red Army. 
Women‘s participation in the war, in the view of many male writers, leads to 
unplanned pregnancies and even rape when men do not control their lust for female 
soldiers. In .To Go and not Return,. the female protagonist has had to harden 
herself in response to her male comrades‘ advances:

In the squad, she had become steadfast, strict, and even rude, only to help her 
defend herself from men‘s attentions. What can one say? It‘s not easy to be 
a young woman amongst so many men, where each one tries to get close to 
her, some really try to help her, to empathize, to ease some of her burden, 
while some are openly or secretly thinking only of their short-lived and 
offensive pleasure. Earlier, when Avdonina was in the squad, it was easier. 
Two women among so many men tried to protect themselves together).413 
In Life and Fate, Katia is scared of being left alone with the male soldiers in her own 
regiment, knowing that they might force themselves upon her.

feminine weakness.415 
In their revisions of World War II, male authors return women to their 
traditional place, removing them from an arena in which men prove themselves. 
These authors aimed to recreate and celebrate the individual experience of the typical 
Red army soldier, who was a man. They had little interest in the martyred heroines 
who had become mythologized to the point they were untouchable. Male authors 
also had little need for strong, independent women warriors. Indeed, these authors 
demoted the warrior to the status of handmaiden, the woman who remained in the 
background of the Red Army soldier‘s story, attractively complementing him in her 
tightly-fitted overcoat.

Chapter 4: ....... ........: 
Women Warriors and Their Epic Battle for Soviet Cultural Memory 
.Don‘t take the mistrust you‘ve encountered here to heart too much. 
After all, you are the first female regiment that ever existed. The men 
are amazed by this, even though you and I see nothing special in it.. 
Raskova was slightly nervous. She often—too often—changed her 
pose: now she leaned forward, supporting herself by resting her hands 
on the table, and now straightened herself, transferring her hands to 
her wide leather shoulder strap and holding it tightly. 
.We shall meet again at the front. I wish you a great deal of 
success…I hope you‘ll earn the honorific of Guards.. 
A loud booming sound burst into the room through the wide 
open windows. Again Likhaya was being bombed. Standing 
shoulder to shoulder, we all thought and felt the same. After all, a 
new chapter was opening up in our lives. We were reluctant to part 
from Raskova, our first commander and a wonderful woman whom 
we considered our role model. Who would have thought we would 
never see her again..416 
In the 437th Fighter Regiment, Litvyak scored her very first two kills 
on 13 September [1942?], three days after her arrival and on her third 
mission to cover Stalingrad, becoming the very first woman fighter 
pilot to shoot down an enemy aircraft.417 
.Since my childhood I have been a freedom-loving Cossack girl 
riding a horse along the Kuban steppes. My spirit has always been 
emancipated, unconquered, and proud. Nothing passes by me 
unnoticed—that is part of my Cossack nature also. Suddenly, out of 
nowhere, a strong desire to fly was born in my flesh..418 
It is deeply ironic that during the post-Soviet period Canadian and American 
women have been the ones to keep alive the memory of the Soviet Union‘s greatest 
women fighters. In the late Soviet period, aviators, tank operators, machine gunners,

and scouts wrote dozens of memoirs that have fallen into oblivion since the collapse 
of the Soviet Union. Canadian historian Kazimiera J. Cottam spent decades 
gathering materials, synthesizing them, and translating into English memoirs first 
published in the Soviet Union. Cottam celebrates the memory of these heroes and 
introduces them to the English-speaking world. Hero of the Soviet Union Nadezhda 
(Meklin) Kravstova described Marina Raskova‘s late 1942 speech in the first 
collection of women‘s recollections of their military aviation service in World War 
II.419 Raskova‘s speech acknowledges the discrimination and lack of respect 
women warriors faced before, during, and would fight after the war. This chapter 
examines the epic efforts of the Soviet Union‘s greatest women fighters, a group of 
aviators who themselves were heroes of epic proportions, for their place in Russian 
cultural memory alongside famous male pilots like Ivan Kozhedub. 
These women‘s contributions during World War II remain relatively 
unknown, both in the former Soviet Union and abroad. Short articles about Soviet 
women pilots have appeared in English since the 1940s, but Cottam‘s 1997 
translation marks the first time these women‘s voices surfaced in the Englishspeaking 
world. In addition to her translations of Russian works by and about 
woman warriors, Cottam contributes to Western readers‘ appreciation of these heroes 
through her biographical sketches, published in Women in War and Resistance. She

includes bibliographies of women warriors and details their heroic contributions to 
the Soviet war effort. 
The pilots wrote about themselves throughout the postwar period, paying 
tribute to Raskova and insisting on their rightful place in cultural memory. They 
detail their individual motivations for fighting on the front and describe gender-based 
discrimination, however, due to centralized, state control of the publishing industry, 
the memoirs could only be published in heavily censored form. Senior Sergeant 
Valentina Kovaleva-Sergeicheva told U.S. World War II veteran Anne Noggle, .For 
the last seventy years of this socialist existence we have been used to saying no 
words about anything at all, to refrain: that is why now we look upon this chance 
with you as an opportunity to relate our stories..420 Noggle‘s published interviews 
read drastically differently from the Soviet-era memoirs. Each interview introduces 
an individual who describes her war experience in both heroic and mundane terms. 
Noggle brings the women alive in the early 1990s, in an era when the woman 
warriors had all but stopped publishing works about themselves. 
In the third epigraph, taken from one of Noggle‘s interviews, the speaker 
situates herself in the centuries-long tradition of women warriors arming themselves 
and fighting on the battlefield by recalling knightly women warriors of the past: the 
polianitsy of East Slavic epic tales, or byliny, and free-spirited Nadezhda Durova, 
whose words also demonstrate the personal drive that brought most of the women to 
420 Noggle, A Dance with Death, 174. 

217 
aviation.421 To judge them from this passage, the speaker saw herself as a .freespirited. 
individual, answering to no one. Her motivation to fly was deeply personal, 
rooted in history, ethnicity, and a romantic love of adventure and risk, and had little 
to nothing to do with patriotism or a love for the Soviet Union. This individual 
motivation to fly, shared by many of the pilots, might be a reason the state ignored 
them. 
The chapter addresses the woman warriors who actively engaged in battle, 
whose faces were unknown to the masses, though many of them were decorated 
Heroes of the Soviet Union, like Liza Chaikina and Zoia Kosmodem‘ianskaia. 
Forgotten in mass culture, these women began to reassert themselves during the 
Thaw period (1956-68). They published their own accounts of their service in World 
War II. Between 1960 and 1989, at least thirty-two memoirs and collections of 
vignettes, written by aviators, appeared in print. While some of the memoirs were 
published by military publishing houses (Voennoe Izdatel‘stvo and Izdatel‘stvo 
DOSAAF), many were published in popular publishing houses (Molodoi chitatel‘, 
Molodaia gvardiia, Lumina, Detskaia literatura). The memoirs typically appeared in 
large print-runs of 100,000 copies. Several of the memoirs were reedited and 
republished. Despite the ideological patina, this corpus of memoirs about these 
aviators is comprised of narratives about individual women who made a heroic 
contribution to the war effort against the Nazis. While they successfully published, 
421 Ibid., 53. 

218 
they never achieved the recognition they expected and deserved. Some Russians 
deny that women ever even participated in combat. 
I have termed these women warriors as polianitsy, an appellation that 
typically refers to the folkloric armed women of byliny, Russian epic poems, 
composed between the tenth and sixteenth centuries. Polianitsy actively waged war, 
fencing and riding horses, challenging male knights (bogatyri). The choice of name 
recalls the centuries-long tradition of women waging war and indicates that they are 
the most recent variations in a national tradition of women warriors. Although they 
remain much less acceptable in mass culture, less acceptable to ordinary Russians, 
and, forgotten by the general public, the polianitsy accomplished much more in 
historical fact for the Motherland than the mythic martyrs Zoia Kosmodemian‘skaia 
and Liza Chaikina. This chapter posits that the polianitsy of World War II represent 
themselves as epic heroes, as truly heroic warriors and that they engage in an 
ongoing fight long after the conclusion of the war for recognition of their heroic 
deeds. While there were many different women warriors who fought on the front 
using various machines, this chapter concentrates on aviators because they made 
such a concerted group effort to place themselves in the center of the nation‘s 
memory. 
Before examining the aviators‘ memoirs, it will be helpful to define some 
terms, particularly the concept of .epic.. An epic can be understood as a narrative 
that deals with a heroic figure or a group of such figures and a historical event, such 
as a war or conquest, or a heroic quest or some other significant achievement that is 

219 
central to the establishing of traditions, the identity of an ethnic group or a nation, 
and its cultural values.422 Epic time is another crucial element. Mikhail Bakhtin 
claims that the epic narrator speaks about a past which is inaccessible to him or 
her423 and that .the represented world of the heroes stands on an utterly different and 
inaccessible time-and-value plane, separated by epic distance. from the singer and 
listener.424 The epic takes place in the deep past, in a heroic situation, in a significant 
place for the nation. 
The epigraphs at the head of this chapter introduce heroic figures who took 
part in the largest mythic event after the Revolution and Civil War: the Great 
Patriotic War, which was central in the Soviet experience. Although the warriors 
actively engaged in this monumental, national event, they remained outsiders in 
national memory and were forgotten in the process of mythmaking about the war. 
Even today, these women warriors are rarely subjects of novels, stories, and films. 
One single film Night Witches (...... ......, 1981), based on the pilots‘ wartime 
experience, was directed by a veteran, Evgeniia Zhigulenko. Not only did these 
women have to fight for the right to fight, they had to fight for a place in national 
memory by writing or making films about themselves. 
Unlike the majority of partisan scouts who were often depicted as martyrs for 
the Soviet cause, the polianitsy were military professionals: aviators, machinegunners, 
snipers, tank-operators, scouts (ambushers, not reconnaissance scouts).

Most had been trained prior to World War II and had been waiting for the 
opportunity to .show their stuff.. In the 1930s, it will be remembered, encouraged 
by media images and living examples, hundreds of thousands of girls and young 
women entered civil defense organizations and prepared themselves as part of the 
Soviet militarization of youth. These women learned how to operate various 
weapons, to fight, to parachute, and to fly. Images of smiling women holding rifles 
and working machine guns graced covers of many popular magazines, such as 
Samolet, Osoaviakhim, and Rabotnitsa. 
As women moved out of private spheres into the public and contributed to the 
industrialization of the country, armed women represented an extreme: the new 
Soviet woman worked in the factory or studied chemistry or engineering at the 
university, but in her spare time, she engaged in war games and sports, familiarized 
herself with weapons, learned to operate vehicles. She was strong and muscular like 
the woman athlete pictured in A. Kokorekin‘s poster, .Be prepared in work and 
defense!. (.. ..... . ....... .... .....!.)425 
During this time of industrialization and militarization, pilots occupied a 
special place in Soviet culture, as they represented the convergence and apex of 
technical achievement, courage, and skill. Soviet children of the 1930s grew up 
amid media reports of Soviet air achievements and propaganda posters commanding

children idolized Valerii Chkalov, the famed test pilot who broke numerous records 
in 1936 and 1937. Raisa Aronova, Hero of the Soviet Union and veteran of the 46th

Women in all arenas soon found role models in nationally celebrated aviators, 
Valentina Grizodubova, Marina Raskova, and Polina Osipenko. Their celebrated 
victory and Raskova‘s autobiography, published in 1939, only encouraged more 
women to step out into the public sphere engaging in traditionally masculine 
activities and to enroll in Osoaviakhim and flight clubs. Dospanova writes:

(I wanted to become a pilot. This dream was not born immediately. With 
great agitation, we schoolchildren, like all Soviet people, followed the 
victories of the first Heroes of the Soviet Union, pilots, who saved the 
Cheliuskin steamship crew. But the nonstop flight from Moscow to the Far 
East, completed by the women pilots Grizodubova, Osipenko, Raskova, made 
a particular impression was made on us. After that, I knew that a woman 
could become an excellent pilot.)428

Already inspired by Chkalov, the first women to become Heroes of the Soviet Union 
showed young women that there were no areas off limits to them, that they, too, 
could defy gravity through love of flight. The media indicated that women were 
welcome in all aspects of Soviet life. 
Although the government officially supported and encouraged women to 
engage in nontraditional activities, ordinary men resisted women‘s participation in 
the military. The polianitsy found themselves engaged in a battle for the right to fight 
(1930-42). Many memoirists describe discrimination on the part of both government 
institutions and individual men. Even after completing training in flight clubs, 
women were not allowed to pursue aviation in higher education. Several of the 
memoirists describe disappointment that they could not accompany their male 
comrades to military academies. Chechneva refused to accept rejection. She looked 
up Raskova‘s telephone number, met with her and begged Raskova to help her get 
into the military academy: ....... ..........!—...... ......... . .... 
........,—.. ........ ... ..... ............! ......., . .. ....... ...!. 
(.=Marina Mikhailovna!‘ I proudly completed my confession, .Help me become a 
fighter-pilot! I swear, I will not disappoint you!.)429 Raskova encouraged her to 
remain in the flight club as an instructor. Chechneva recalls: ... ... .. ..... ..

223 
depressed.).430 Such women clearly dreamt of flying at war and were frustrated by 
contradictory messages: become aviators, but not in the highest levels of the military. 
The Soviet policy of excluding women from combat flight continued after the 
commencement of the war, June 22, 1941. Like thousands of other Komsomol 
members, the women who had trained in civil defense organizations flooded 
recruiters‘ offices, eager to serve at the front. Meri Avidzba, a pilot and a student at 
the Leningrad Military-Medical Academy, appealed to a recruiter as Leningrad 
burned: ..—........ .. .... ........, ... ...... ......... ....... .

(.I am a pilot. I cannot watch what the damned fascists are doing with my beloved

she knows how to fly, but is sent home to work with other young women behind the 
lines. Dospanova remembers that she and other students harbored one hope: to help 
the Motherland. She felt as though she were surrounded by danger, and she burned 
with the desire to go to the front and battle fascism.435 Polina Gelman tells Noggle, 
.We were patriotic and wanted to do something, to enlist or whatever.. She 
continues: .We hated the German fascists so much that we didn‘t care which aircraft 
we were to fly; we could have flown a broom to be able to fire at them!.436 The 
women warriors yearned to fight.

reconnaissance scouts or combat nurses, they initially dismissed would-be fighters:

coming here. Come on, girl, don‘t get in the way. Go home‘.).437 Gelman describes 
the pilots' confusion about contradictory official positions regarding women in 
combat: .When we women applied to join the army along with the men, we were not 
accepted because the army would not draft women. We protested that we were 
brought up to believe that women were equal to men, and we thought that we should 
be allowed to go into the army, too..438 The women worked in the rear in various 
capacities, building fortifications or teaching aviation in flight clubs, waiting for 
mobilization, and besieging officials with requests to serve.439 
The pilots gained the right to fight through Raskova‘s advocacy.440 Many 
memoirists recall how they rushed to Raskova, claiming they would be willing to do 
anything to be admitted into the regiments. After interviewing the women, Raskova 
placed them in three regiments: a night bomber regiment, flying the PO-2, a divebomber 
regiment, flying the PE-2, and a fighter regiment, flying the Yak-1. 
Although women had initially claimed that they would do anything to go to the front, 
most really wanted to wage war in the most aggressive manner: as fighter pilots. 
Marina Chechneva writes of disappointment when Raskova informed her that she 
would be flying the PO-2, an open-cockpit biplane, designed by N. N. Polikarpov in 
1927.441 Most women wanted to command a fighter plane and engage in combat 
one-on-one with Nazi pilots, though they all accepted their assignments and grew to

439 Pennington posits that it was Raskova‘s idea to form women‘s air regiments. In Spring 1942, 
100,000 women were conscripted for the Air Defense Force. Pennington, Wings, Women, and War,

love their planes, even the primitive, open cockpit PO-2. Many of the memoirists 
remember Raskova‘s inspiring words during their training. Dospanova remembers 
Raskova‘s determination to assert women‘s right to fight:

(Marina Mikhailovna spoke about the eternal dream of women, about 
equality. In the Soviet Union, women had received equal rights with men in 
labor and recreation, the right to stand at the machine and to lead in the 
government, and now, when Hitler‘s hordes descended upon us, we‘ve 
received the right to defend the Motherland with weapons in our hands, along 
with our husbands, fathers, and brothers. And as a display of these equal 
rights, the party had charged her, Raskova, with the formation of women‘s 
aviation units. 
.We received the right to be warriors, and we will realize this right in battle,. 
she concluded).442 
Raskova may have used the argument that women were supposed to have equal 
rights in the Soviet Union and should, thus, be granted the right to wage war 
alongside men, when she requested Stalin‘s permission to form the women‘s 
regiments. 
If the first battle was to be able to fly, the aviators‘ next battle was the actual 
fight against fascism (1942-45). The memoirists portray themselves as highly 
competent, decorated, celebrated women who proved themselves to be as capable as 
male aviators under the most difficult of conditions. The women fought effectively 
442 ........., ... ............. ........, 24. 

227 
and were honored throughout the war. Two of the three regiments were designated 
as Guards regiments. In all twenty-nine women pilots, from all three regiments, 
were eventually named Heroes of the Soviet Union. The Soviets awarded the 
women with decorations, wine, and even high-heeled shoes! They were recognized 
internationally. In July 1944, the U. S. magazine, Aviation, featured the women in 
an article by Madeline Blitzstein: .How Women Flyers Fight Russia‘s Air War.. 
The Germans nicknamed them .night witches.. Late in the war, a regiment of 
French pilots, delighted by the women, presented them with watches. Some men 
admitted that they underestimated women, as does the brigade commissar, Gorbunov 
in Chechneva‘s Airplanes Fly into the Night (........ ...... . ....).

(=And who would have guessed,‘ answered Gorbunov. =I also was among 
those opposed. You know, your appearance on the front was very unusual. 
Now I see that we were greatly mistaken, that we had underestimated Soviet 
women.‘ 
=It‘s nothing new,‘ I noted. =Before the war, there were many male flightinstructors 
who also did not want to train young women.‘ 
=Really? 
=Ask any female member of a flight club‘).443 
The women pilots believed that they had proven that although men and 
women were different and had different strengths, women were as capable as men, if

not better, at flying planes in combat. Lieutenant Evgeniia Guruleva-Smirnova tells 
Anne Noggle, .We had fewer casualties in our regiment than the men did flying the 
same type of aircraft; I think we were more precise in our flying..444 They thought 
erroneously, however, that through their performance they had changed minds, and 
subsequently, changed prejudice against women in combat in Soviet culture. 
This chapter focuses on the aviators‘ last and longest fight: their efforts 
throughout the 1960s to the 1980s to be remembered. Almost immediately upon the 
conclusion of the war, the regiments were demobilized. Some were happy, like 
Sergeant Anna Kirilina, who tells Noggle, .when I returned to the plant, entered the 
room, and saw my textile instrument standing there, I rushed up to it. I was 
extremely happy that I had returned to peaceful labor..445 Most left the military, but 
a few were able to continue serving in army-aviation. Galina Markova writes of 
Klavdiia Fomicheva:

(One after another we were demobilized from the army. We removed our 
fading soldier‘s shirts, said .farewell. to our combat machines. Klava 
continued to serve, passing on her combat experience and her knowledge to 
the younger generation of pilots. Then she moved to the air force academy 
where she started working as a flight instructor).446

All, regardless of postwar careers, were proud of their collective and individual 
contributions to the war effort and their accomplishments. All expected to be 
remembered by their country, ordinary people and leaders alike. Upon 
demobilization, most women left aviation. Some returned to universities. Olga 
Khomiakova, one of the women who remained in military aviation, describes 
continued discrimination, in some ways worse than before the war. In the media, 
images of fighting women were replaced by mothers holding children. The few 
women who did achieve immortality in mass culture were martyrs, like Zoia 
Kosmodem‘ianskaia. Although Raskova was the one notable exception to this 
consignment to oblivion, it should be noted that she had achieved Hero of the Soviet 
Union status prior to the war and was celebrated, not for her contribution to the war 
effort, but rather for her achievements during the 1930s peacetime militarization 
period. To this day, Russian documentaries focus on her prewar military 
achievements, rather than her role in the war effort. 
This situation must have been exceedingly frustrating for the women who had 
fought so bravely in war, as the war continued to live within them. Golubeva-Teres 
writes of the women‘s changed social identities and the feelings of alienation some 
of them experienced:

(Looking at the decorations and medals, shining under the sun and fastened to 
the smart uniforms of the women, the civilian public was enchanted. The 
public did not know that it was difficult for all of the people demobilized 
after the war: how to live afterwards, how immediately to answer the 
multitude of questions and fulfill the tasks of peacetime. For example, where 
should one live? Some did not have apartments, rooms, or even their own 
corners. What should one do? Where should one work? Of necessity, our 
first profession had been the military: pilot, navigator, mechanic, armorer. 
And one really fine day, all of this receded into the past. Everyone wanted 
quickly to exchange the soldier‘s overcoat for a coat, the soldier‘s shirt and 
pants, for dresses and women‘s jackets, boots for shoes.)447 
Larisa Shepitko depicts the demilitarized woman pilot‘s experience in her 1966 film 
Wings (......). Especially in the case of the 46th Guards night bomber regiment, 
veterans did not stop identifying themselves as pilots and members of the regiment 
just because their regiment had been officially demobilized. Although they 
continued to meet twice a year in front of the Bolshoi Theater, the nation remained 
virtually silent about their heroic deeds. They had been pushed into a corner, passed 
over, while as a whole, the nation was encouraged to be proud of Soviet performance 
in World War II. 
During the Thaw period, the aviators began fighting back, wielding their pens 
as weapons in a third epic battle, this time for a more prominent place in the Soviet 
collective memory. They continued to challenge boundaries through writing about 
their heroic feats, just as they did in the 1930s through flight. How did the aviators

structure their memoirs in order to achieve the goal of a fuller representation in the 
Soviet memory of World War II. Why did these epic warriors garner much less 
public attention than the young, less trained and less effective .martyrs?. 
The works about polianitsy differ from the body of works about the martyrs. 
Both groups suffered and gave themselves to defense of the Motherland, but the 
polianitsy's contribution did not become part of the Soviet lore of World War II as 
their particular type of contribution was marginalized by the demobilization that 
followed World War II. The martyrs were idealized to the extent that the most 
famous ones, Zoia Kosmodem‘ianskaia and Liza Chaikina, became icons, whose 
mere images and names inspired mourning and indignation and moved the public, 
first to avenge their deaths during the war and then, in the postwar period, to lead 
moral, useful lives as Soviet citizens. The works treated in this chapter were 
intended to fill readers with pride and awe at the epic feats of individual women‘s 
heroic deeds, rather than their ultimate sacrifices for the Motherland. 
The vast majority of works about the polianitsy are either memoirs or 
biographies written about fallen aviators by comrades in arms. They also published 
journals, letters, children‘s books, and two versions of a novella (K. Larionova‘s The 
Nagivator Rumiantseva (....... ........., 1949) and The Starry Road: A 
Novella (........ ......: ......., 1963). Editors included occasional vignettes 
in autobiographical World War II publications. Journals such as Rabotnitsa and 
newspapers like Krasnaia zvezda (The Red Star) included rare articles on women 

232 
warriors. With the exception of some of the vignettes and articles, the authors were 
women. 
Interestingly, one of the first works were not memoirs, but novellas. One 
may see this publication as a first attempt, disguised as fiction, before the mass 
assault of memoirs the aviators launched in the 1960s. K. Larionova‘s novel The 
Navigator Rumiansteva was based on the 46th guards‘ regiment in 1949. Many of 
the episodes come directly from women‘s war experiences and resemble descriptions 
in memoirs. For some reason, possibly related to demilitarization and the public‘s 
rejection of the image of the military woman, Larionova felt most comfortable 
presenting the pilots‘ war experience as fiction.448 That year, the first memoir, 
Ul‘ianenko‘s Nezabyvaemoe, was published in a province, the Udmurt Republic. It 
would be the only memoir for the next eleven years.449 In 1955, a version of the 
diary and letters by the deceased Hero of the Soviet Union, Evgeniia Rudneva, 
appeared. Rudneva‘s diary was almost certainly heavily edited for ideologically 
correctness. 
After these three early publications, the women turned almost exclusively to 
memoirs and began representing themselves in their own words. In memoir form, 
they claimed their actions and detailed their specific contributions to the war effort. 
This choice of genre dates back to the first female Russian officer: Nadezhda 
Durova, who fictionalized parts of her memoir and omitted facts (marriage, child), 
448 Although I suspect that .Larionova. was a pen name one of the veterans used, I have found no 
evidence in RGALI to support this theory. 
449 N. Ul‘ianenko, Nezabyvaevmoe (Izhevsk: Udmurtgosizdat, 1949). 

233 
perhaps recognizing that her audience would not understand her decision to leave her 
husband and child for a military life. 
Although women who fought in various capacities published memoirs, the 
pilots published more than anyone. They were an elite, educated group and 
continued to meet as a unified collective twice a year long after demobilization. The 
war remained alive in their interactions as they symbolically, regularly reconvened 
as a unit. One can assume that each supported the others‘ decisions to write about 
their experiences. 
Of the pilots, veterans of the 46th guards unit who flew night bombers in 
open-cockpit biplanes published the most. Of the three women‘s regiments formed 
by Raskova, the 46th regiment was the first to be designated a guard unit, the only 
one to remain solely a women‘s regiment, and the one to produce the largest number 
of Heroes of the Soviet Union. The two most prolific writers, Marina Chechneva 
and Nadezhda Kravtsova, were veterans of this regiment. Evgeniia Zhigulenko tells 
Noggle: .All of us who were navigators looked upon ourselves as a very elite group 
because our backgrounds were in the institutes and universities. We were well-read, 
intellectually minded, had good manners, and never heard or said dirty words..450 
After the war, many aviators earned advanced degrees. 
By publishing memoirs, the pilots fulfilled two needs, first to express their 
individual contributions to the war effort and, second, to make a bid for public 
memory and honor. During the Thaw, the period following Stalin‘s death, one finds 
450 Noggle, A Dance with Death, 54. 

234 
a resurgence of the thinking self, independent and critical of the state. Characteristic 
of the Thaw period, the aviators introduce a personal world, an individual passion— 
this time for flight and combat. Although the memoirs resemble each other, each 
one details the author‘s personal experience of entrance into aviation and Raskova‘s 
influence. When reading these memoirs, one must keep in mind that the pilots‘ 
stories were almost certainly heavily edited by both by the authors themselves and by 
state censors. Publishers may have employed ghostwriters, which would explain the 
similarities amongst works. A comparison of the Soviet era memoirs with oral 
interviews conducted by an American veteran, Anne Noggle, translated and 
published in the United States in 1994, suggests that the women were more 
ambitious and independent, less dedicated to Stalin, and more interested in male 
attention then their memoirs indicate. One woman was grounded for several months 
after smearing the words ... ........ .For Stalin. when a painter painted ... 
......! .. .......!. (.For the Motherland! For Stalin!.) on her plane. She was 
grounded for several months. One of the women admits to Noggle that she enlisted 
in the army for a mundane reason: because she was attracted by the healthier food 
rations. Although the polianitsy are not idealized to the extent of the martyrs, they– 
or their ghostwriters and editors—do give the impression of being enthusiastic 
patriots. 
Questions as to the audience for these memoirs and their purpose must be 
answered if we are to understand the nature of the aviators‘ quest for a place in the 
national memory: are the authors writing for young women, young men, or both? 

235 
Are they writing to educate the younger generation, which is largely ignorant of their 
feats or are the writing to push the boundaries of gender roles and expectations? 
Through their descriptions of heroic achievements and skilled flying, many 
make the case for women‘s inclusion in the military. The memoirs suggest that they 
are writing either to encourage young women to enter aviation or to challenge 
assumptions that men are better suited for certain professions, or they are addressing 
those who doubt history, those who argue that women could not have possibly 
performed as well as men. 
Motivation and intended audiences vary from author to author, but 
Chechneva, who worked for DOSAAF, the successor to Osoaviakhim, as a flight 
instructor after the war, writes to inspire young people to become aviators: .... 
..... ...... ...... ... ......... ... .... .... ........ ........... 
...... ......, ..... .. . ..... 
(.One cannot read this book without agitation. It will teach our youth to love the 
Motherland without limits. It will call them into the sky.).451 If the intended goal 
was to call young people to the sky, then the intended audience must be a male or 
mixed audience, as only young men would have been able to take to the sky and 
become military pilots in the 1960s and 1970s. However, regardless of Chechneva‘s 
introduction, young women were more likely the intended audience of the pilots‘ 
memoirs. Although they could not become military pilots at the moment of 
451 ......., ........ ... ......., 135. 

236 
publication, the women heroes show younger women how to go against the grain, 
how to challenge gender-based obstacles. 
There are several indicators that the ideal reader was a young woman. 
Numerous memoirists describe how the women pilots fought as well, if not better, 
than male pilots. Rakobol‘skaia remembered: 
There were a few cases when the aircraft would be over the target, and a 
bomb would stick and not drop. The navigator would get out of the cockpit, 
stand on the wing, and reach down with her hands to try to push it loose. The 
women were as brave as the male crews. 
We had parties and danced and sang, and we had amateur contests 
and wrote poetry. The first slogan of the regiment was: You are a woman, 
and you should be proud of that. When weather caused the cancellation of a 
mission, everyone stayed at the airfield and danced. It would never come 
into any man‘s head to do that, while waiting for permission to fly.452 
Senior Lieutenant Serafima Amosova-Taranenko supports the view that women 
pilots were just as brave and able as the men: .The female regiment performed better 
and made more combat flights each night than the male regiment. The male pilots 
before a flight started smoking and talking, but the women even had supper in the 
cockpit of their aircraft..453 
Rakobolskaya and Amosova-Taranenko emphasize aviators‘ talents and 
bravery, their equality with men, but also stress their pride in being women. The 
polianitsy did not reject their gender and assume androgynous identities. Instead, 
they embraced both their .femininity. and their roles as warriors. Such statements 
would most likely not appeal to male readers. The authors also discuss romantic 
details and descriptions of handicrafts, which a male reader might find silly.

the following epigraph: ...... ......., ........... ........... ....., 
......... (.To my daughters, the komsomolki of the 1970s, I dedicate this 
book.).454 Clearly, her intended readers were the women of the next generation. 
Regardless of the intended audience, the authors portray themselves as heroes 
which can best be illustrated with Chechneva‘s introduction of Girls Flew in a 
Guards. Regiment (...... ....... . ...........), about aviators Zhenia 
Krutova and Zoia Parfenova. She chooses the following epigraph taken from the

This epigraph locates the action of the narrative in the recent past during the Great 
Patriotic War .on the front, in the advancing regiments. (... ...... ..... . .... 
..........). The situation is clearly a war situation. The brave, tireless heroes 
who thump the enemy from dusk to dawn are women—fearless women. They are 
fighting for the glory of their regiment. Hero of the Soviet Union Nadezhda 
(Meklin) Kravtsova, and by choice of this epigraph, Chechneva, are represented by 
folkloric images usually reserved for men: eagles and knights (bogatyri). The 
epigraph introduces Krutova, and the other women of the 46th, as heroic knights who 
fight the enemy. The author clearly aims to represent the members of the 46th 
precisely as epic heroes. 
Epic heroes take part in events that take place in the deep past, at a defining 
point in a nation‘s formation which serves a key role in the formation of a nation‘s 
collective memory. L. I. Litvinova begins her memoir by juxtaposing the peaceful 
present, in which she awaits a comrade-in-arms in a Moscow train station, with the 
distant, wartime past: ...... ......... ... . .... . ....... ....... ....... 
............. ...... (.Long ago, battles quieted down and entered the history of 
events of the Great Fatherland War.).456 Typically, the generation reciting the epic is 
far removed from the time in which the epic events occur. Although only a 
generation had passed between the conclusion of World War II and the period of the 
1960s, the new generation, the intended reader, already regarded the war as an event 
of .long ago.. Many of them did not comprehend the pilots‘ heroic deeds at the time 
456 .. .. ........, ..... ....... ......... (......: .......... ......., 1976), 5. 

239 
the women were penning memoirs. In their memoirs the aviators attempt to educate 
future generations about their contributions. Chechneva concludes her first memoir: 
[.] .......... .... ........ . ..., ... ...... ...., ... .......... . 
... ......... ... ....... ....... ........., ... ... ........ .... 
....... ........ ........ ..... . ...... ...... . ..., ... . 
...... ....... ......... ......... .. ...... ....... ......... 
......... 
(I merely tried to relate what I saw myself, what survived and was preserved 
in my memory. I hope that my modest work helps the young reader to know 
better and more about how young Soviet patriots defended the Motherland 
during the period of difficult trials).457 
At the time of publication, Chechneva clearly felt that the younger generation did not 
fully understand how the previous generation had performed during the war and 
wrote to correct this paucity. 
Several of the authors begin or conclude memoirs by describing their 
experiences to members of the next generation. Ol‘ga Timofeevna Golubeva-Teres 
is very conscious of her role as memory keeper. She starts her memoir, Pages from 
My Flight Log: A Novella (........ .. ...... ......: .......), by answering 
her youngest daughter‘s question: ....., .. ..... .... ... ......?. (.But why 
do you have these papers, Mama?.) as the narrator removes documents related to her 
military service from an upper drawer, long out of reach. This scene represents the 
narrator‘s removal of her experience from the dusty drawer of forgotten history and 
her attempt to convey her service and heroism to her daughter. She describes actions 
by listing the documents and writes about the symbolism of her notes: ....... . 
...... ...... ....., .. .. ......... .... ..... ...., ..... ...... ... 
457 ......., ........ ...... . ...., 157. 

240 
......... ......, . ...... ...... .... ......... .. ........, ........., 
........ ....... (.The notations in the flight log are laconic, but behind the few 
words stand nights, when every hour was measured by life, and when every minute 
was an examination of courage, honor, and loyalty to the Motherland.).458 The 
reader witnesses the younger generation‘s inability to conceptualize the veterans‘ 
experiences when the impatient daughter, representative of her generation, insists 
that her mother put down the war documents and take her out for a walk. As 
Golubeva-Teres flips through her flight log, each two or three line entry reminds her 
of her wartime experience, and although long hidden out of view like the flight log, 
the war vividly comes back to her, even through the most laconic of passages. One 
sees the disjunction between generations: the war remains alive in the pilots‘ 
memories but is completely absent from their children‘s experience. Golubeva- 
Teres‘s daughter clearly does not care that her mother fought heroically to defend her 
country. 
Pilot and Hero of the Soviet Union Aronova‘s epigraph, .... ...... . 
....... ......, ... ...... ....... ........ (.The farther we go into the 
future, the more we value the past.), shows her motivation to pen her memoirs: she 
cherishes the past and her part in it. 459 She is determined to preserve the past. It 
should be noted that this valuation of the past and fixation on the glorious victory, on 
the defeat of Nazi Germany, is certainly not something unique to women veterans.

In recent years, in honor of May 9, there has been an annual, public-awareness 
campaign encouraging people to wear or display black and gold ribbons which mean 
.I remember, I am proud. (......, ........). However, the women‘s insistence 
on memory is more significant than the typical Russian pride in liberation of the 
world from fascism. They have an agenda: restoration of themselves, mostly 
forgotten, into their national history. 
Sometimes the author‘s choice of final image concludes the work by 
illustrating that the war is still a very large part of her experience as a human being 
and that she still sees herself as an aviator. By extension, those who recall the war 
should include her in it. For example, Galina Markova, who is generally more 
present in her narratives than other authors, concludes her 1983 memoir, Tell, Birch 
Trees (........., ..........), with a stock image from aviation films and literary 
works: she, a navigator, and her long-deceased pilot Klavdiia Fomicheva are flying 
together in spirit, long before other pilots have replaced them in the sky: 
...... ........—.........., .............—........... ....... .

(Today, other planes, jet planes, supersonic aircraft, ascend into the sky from 
the airfields. Other pilots navigate the sky. But in the whistle of the wind, 
coming from the Moscow River down the street with the chain of snowcovered 
faces, I hear the familiar rumble of the soaring Pe-2 and the voice of 
a friend: 
=So, June, is everything in order ...‘?)460 
460 ......., ........ ......, 137. 

242 
Markova asserts her identity and demonstrates the place the war holds in her 
memory, while glorifying a comrade who died in the 1950s of an undisclosed illness 
related to her military service. Markova shows that the war is still alive within her, 
and by extension, the Soviet Union, by concluding her narrative with an image, the 
image of the narrator navigating with her pilot. Through these specific combat 
images, the pilots return to their nation‘s defining moment: the righteous battle 
against fascism, so alive in their memories. Despite the passage, in some cases, of 
less than twenty years, World War II had already faded into history and myth in the 
Russian national consciousness at the time of publication. 
The epic event forms a defining moment in nation building, in this case, the 
liberation of the Homeland, the beloved Soviet Union. Mikhail Bakhtin argues that 
.the epic as it has come down to us is an absolutely completed and finished generic 
form, whose constitutive feature is the transferal of the world it describes to an 
absolute past of national beginnings and peak times,. a time of nation-building, a 
pivotal moment in the nation‘s history.461 The Soviets experienced such a moment 
when their young country‘s existence was threatened by the Nazi invasion on June 
22, 1941. Memoirists convey that the pilots were initially motivated to fight after 
their Homeland, which Soviet authors usually idealize as a peaceful, glorious place, 
was attacked by .beasts..462 Larionova describes a navigator‘s reaction to the 
wartime destruction in her fictional narrative: ..... .......... .... ...... .. 
461 Mikhail Bakhtin, .Epic and Novel,. in The Dialogic Imagination, 15. 
462 Chechneva includes a short poem taken from her diary which illustrates the feelings young people 
had toward the Motherland during the pre-war period: .. ...... .... ......./ . ..... 
......... ......,/ ........ .. ......../ ..... . ..... ....... ("I dream of being a pilot/ In 
our happy country,/ To pass birds,/ In the blue sky in an airplane,)" ........ ...... . ...., 8.

(.Katia sighed. Grief interfered with her celebration. It was too hard to see these 
results of the war. But you will not help your grief with tears. You need to take 
revenge on your enemy and not weaken from grief, but hit him without missing.).463 
The women felt a burning desire to defend their Motherland at the moment of 
national crisis, and after witnessing Nazi atrocities, avenge the deaths of unarmed 
fellow citizens. Valia Luchinkina wrote Marina Chechneva: .. ......., ... 
....... ...... ..... ........ ......... ... ..... ......, ....... ....... 
.. . ....... ... ...... ... ...... . ...... .... .. ..........…. (.I am 
sure that the girls of our regiment always kept that fire of the heart, which awoke 
them during the terrible days for the Motherland, and motivated them to arise in the 
first rows of her defenders….)464 As the narratives progress, the authors specify the 
areas in which they were stationed and they detail those that they liberated, 
emphasizing the significance of the epic fight on Soviet land, highlighting their role 
in the restoration and building of the Soviet state. 
As warriors build their nation through battle, many armed and unarmed 
citizens die. Epic heroes, like Achilles, are traditionally motivated by vengeance. 
As the war continued, pilots died, and as the aviators witnessed more atrocities and 
experienced personal losses, they became more and more motivated by a desire to

avenge the dead. The pilots wreaked vengeance by nightly bombing of Nazi camps 
and installations. After losing comrades-in-arms, they dropped bombs in their 
comrades‘ names. Larionova emphasizes this note of personal revenge: ... ....., 
.......... ....., .......... ...... .. ...: =.. ......!. .. .....!‘. (.At

Katia Rumiantseva initially enlisted in the military due to patriotic feelings, but these 
passages show that after the death of Katia‘s best friend, the war with the Nazis 
becomes a personal war.

and personal losses transform young pilots into fierce warriors, or epic heroes 
fighting a decisive battle, building a nation for future generations. 
These epic heroes, the Soviet polianitsy, are not born epic heroes: they 
undergo a transformation into heroes. The aviators describe this process in their 
memoirs. The key transformative moments occur after enlistment in the military. 
They travel from various hometowns all over Russia to Engels for training and 
physically transform into uniformed warriors.474 Many of them initially resent short 
hair cuts and laugh at the male uniforms. Dospanova describes efforts to escape the 
mandatory haircuts: ....... ......... ........, ... .... . ...... ...... .. 
...... ......, ... .... .. .... ....... ...... .........., ... ... ..., 
........, ...... .. ...... .. ... ......... . ...... . ............... 
(.Each strove to prove that braids and curls absolutely did not interfere with flying, 
that they need to tell that to Marina Mikhailovna, that she, surely, did not know 
anything about it. But they lined us up and took us the the hairdresser.).475 Although 
they wanted to fight and felt equal to men, most had no desire to look masculine.

the next day, we received our military uniforms. That was really funny. They gave 
us men‘s things, down to the underwear. A lot of the uniforms did not fit and the 
girls looked awkward and funny in them. The boots were especially distressing, 
since they were almost all sizes 40-43.).476 But, despite initial resistance, upon 
physical transformation, their self-images change and they begin to see themselves 
as warriors in their memoirs, especially after their oath to fight as a regiment. 
Chechneva describes their images of themselves: .... ...... .. ..... 
.......... ........ . ...., ... ... ......... .. ..... ..... .... ....., 
.. ....... ......... ........ ...... . ....... . .... .. ....... 
......., ..... ........ ......... . ...... ........ ...... .. .... (.That 
was when we became real warriors. With those who already shed blood on the fields 
of war, we were connected by the indestructible bonds of military duty and honor. 
And if we violate our oath then let there be all the more contempt and may death 
punish each of us.).477 They saw themselves as true warriors. 
With their oath of loyalty, the aviators become soldiers officially, but for the 
women of the night bomber regiment, the key transfiguative moment occurs when 
Marina Raskova, their leader and role model, gives them a speech just before the 
aviators enter combat. Through her speech, Raskova transforms them: right before 
they are sent out to wage war, she inspires them as they become warriors. Dospanova 
writes:

(Before takeoff, Marina Mikhailovna talked with us a long time. She spoke 
of the party and about the government, about the fact that the Soviet people 
had entrusted us with military machines, had sent us to defend the 
Motherland and that we needed to be proud of this trust and justify it. Even 
though we were full of inspired impulses, even though we hoped to soon 
seize the enemy, the warm, earnest words of Raskova about the noble duty of 
war were the most needed at that time, it seemed. She spoke of the fact that 
fascism would bring the world slavery, poverty, and hunger. She spoke about 
Hitler‘s insane plans to dominate the world).478 
Almost all memoirists of the 46th guards recall Raskova‘s speech in their memoirs, 
showing the importance of Raskova and this key moment in their development into 
epic heroes. She transformed them into warriors by focusing on their patriotic duty 
to defend their Homeland against a hated enemy and their desires to prove 
themselves equal, if not superior, to male pilots. 
This occasion was the last time the aviators saw Raskova, as she died in a 
plane crash in January 1943. As the martyrs moved the nation to avenge them, 
Raskova‘s death inspired the women pilots to fight. The warriors were devastated by 
her death, but dedicated their future successes and combat acts to her memory.

.Major Marina Mikahilovna Raskova died as a soldier, fulfilling her combat 
duty. She fulfilled her duty before the Motherland honorably and to the end.

Marina Mikhailovna. All Soviet people knew her and delighted in her 
victories.).481 
For the aviators, Marina Raskova represented all they strove to become. Upon her 
death, they felt even more compelled to fight bravely, honorably, and effectively, 
and the night bomber regiment was honored as the 46th Guards Unit.

The Soviet polianitsa shares several key characteristics with Soviet positive 
heroes, who, as defined by Katerina Clark, represent .what ought to be..482 The 
polianitsy are fearless, clever, bold, proud, elite, self-assured women. They show 
leadership and skill in dealing with deadly situations. They are loyal to their cause 
and to each other. Like positive heroes, the women are willing to sacrifice 
themselves to build the future through their military service, liberating the Homeland 
for future generations of Soviet children. Verbal descriptions of their actions show 
that they are able, kind, and brave. Pictures of the women having good times 
together demonstrate their cohesiveness as a group and their congeniality. They 
were capable of accomplishing almost inconceivable deeds in wretched conditions 
and often seemed better, stronger, larger than life. 
While congenial, the polianitsy were aggressive. Although they initially told 
recruiters and Raskova that they wanted to serve the Motherland in whatever 
capacity open to them, most really wanted to become fighter pilots in order to engage 
in one-on-one combat. Almost all of the aviators chosen to fly the PO-2, were 
initially disappointed, as they did not want to drop bombs over invisible targets. 
They wanted individually to fight Nazis, wanted to attack Nazi planes, almost as if 
fencing on a battlefield. They wanted to see their opponents and to shoot them 
down. 
The polianitsy were passionate: passionate about fighting and about flying. 
Galina Markova takes her epigraph from a poem by Iuliia Drunina: ...., ... .....

1985), 46.

(.No, those aren‘t huts that are burning—/That is my youth aflame./ Girls go into 
war,/ Looking like boys.).483 Not only does Markova paint pictures of a young 
woman in a man‘s guise whose youth is on fire,—passionate, burning to fight, 
burning for great, heroic deeds, burning away, like the women in her narrative, but 
she legitimizes her work by invoking the only famous woman-warrior poet. Upon 
learning that Raskova is forming women‘s aviation regiments, a recruiter tells 
Makarova and Malakhova: .... . ..... ........... .... ....... ....... 
....... .. ...... (.Now you can fulfill your burning desire to go to the front.).484 
Almost all of the women express a burning drive, almost possession, by 
aviation. Senior Lieutenant Evgeniya Zhigulenko tells Anne Noggle: .Since my 
childhood I have been a freedom-loving Cossack girl riding a horse along the Kuban 
steppes. My spirit has always been emancipated, unconquered, and proud. Nothing 
passes by me unnoticed—that is part of my Cossack nature also. Suddenly, out of 
nowhere, a strong desire to fly was born in my flesh..485 The aviators loved their 
planes as if they were animate beings. ...-2—....... ...... ....... ..

in night battles. It was not without reason that pilots and fighters proudly called the 
PO-2 the =master sergeant of the air‘.); and further: .. ............., .. ...., 
......., .. ...... ...... ......., ....... .. ........ .. ..-2. ..... 
........... . ..... ........ ...... ............... ... ..... .... 
.... ..-2. (.And actually, it seemed as if there were no job that the PO-2 could 
not do. For the enemy, the PO-2 was the most worrying and the scariest night 
bomber.).486 The plane simply replaces the horse, as an officer‘s vehicle in battle). 
The women succeeded in aviation and in battle because they were persistent 
and determined when they encountered adversity. Almost all describe 
discrimination. After transfering to a male regiment, Lilia Litviak had to fight for 
the right to fly her own plane.487 The pilots‘ passion for aviation, and later their 
dedication to the Motherland and their need to avenge the deaths of sisters-in-arms 
drove them to overcome difficulties. Many pilots describe how they and their 
comrades crash-landed, spent months recuperating in hospitals and sanitariums, 
pushing themselves back into their cockpits as soon as possible. 
The aviators were decisive leaders, who sometimes interpreted service 
differently than their commanders. In the second scene of Valutskii‘s and 
Zhigulenko‘s film, two pilots help an injured pilot, Galia, escape from a hospital in 
order to return to her regiment. Galia is later reprimanded for not following her 
orders, but after arguing that she had fully recovered, she is cleared for combat. 
486 ........., ..... ....... ........., 38. 
487 .. ........, ....... .. ......! (......: ....... .........., 1971), 12-14. 

253 
The women believed in themselves. Kravtsova writes about Olga 
Iamshchika: ........ ........ ... .. ..... . ...... ......, ... ... ....... 
....... . ..... ..... ...... ........ ...., . .... ........... (.She did 
not have any doubts and she firmly believed that one could achieve anything she 
strove for.).488 Self-assurance is a vital part of a combat pilot‘s or navigator‘s 
character. Furthermore, the women warriors would have never become pilots during 
peacetime if they had not believed that they were capable of flight, regardless of 
conservative men‘s opposition. 
The authors stress their bravery. They overcome fear and maintain clarity of 
thinking in stressful situations. Kravtsova describes Litviak‘s mental state prior to 
battle: .......... ........, .... . ........... ..... ....... ...... ... 
..., ....., . ........ ... ...... ....... . ...…...... ... ..... .. 
.......! ...... .... ..... .........., ... .........., ... ..... .......,

awaited the moment to attack. There they were, the enemy, with whom she now was 
beginning combat...Now she saw they perfectly! Firmly holding the joystick, having 
prepared everything as if before a jump, Lilia prepared for battle.).489 In 
Zhigulenko‘s film, the women appear fearless in battle. Throughout the film, they 
are ready and eager to undertake any orders given to them by their commanding 
officers. Under fire, the pilots drop their bombs before escaping danger.

It is woth mentioning that the memoirists carefully modified the epic model 
to demonstrate that they were .normal. women, despite their military service, as the 
veterans refer to their gender throughout the works. While they maintained that they 
performed as well, and in some cases, better than male aviators, most aviators 
enjoyed dressing as women and engaging in traditionally .women‘s. pastimes. 
Armorer Ekaterina Chuikova tells Noggle, .Youth is youth. We made pillows out of 
our foot cloths and embroidered the PE-2 on them. Everyone embroidered the PE-2 
on their pillows..490 
The film Night Witches (...... ......) includes a subplot in which pilot 
Oksana and navigator Galia rescue a young boy who becomes an honorary, if 
temporary, member of the women‘s regiment. Oksana hopes to adopt the child with 
her husband. The memoirists and filmmakers attempt to send a clear message: being 
a warrior does not mean that one cannot be a woman, perhaps in an attempt to 
contradict rumors or a general belief that it is not natural for a woman to wage war. 
They visually support this merging of the images of epic hero and traditional woman 
with pictures and illustrations. These pictures illustrate, for those who are incapable 
of reading, that the women pilots were heroic, brave, capable, determined, beautiful, 
and feminine. They emphasize their ..............,. or .femininity,. in response 
to the assumption that a warrior could not be a woman. 
In keeping with the epic mode, these women describe their heroic deeds. J. 
K. Newman writes, .The epic often focuses on a hero, sometimes semi-divine, who 
490 Noggle, A Dance with Death, 145. 

255 
performs difficult and virtuous deeds; it frequently involves the interaction between 
human beings and gods. The events of the poem, however, affect the lives of 
ordinary human beings and often change the course of the nation..491 Unlike those 
who write about martyrs, authors of works about polianitsy include detailed 
descriptions of battles, of actual warrior experiences. Evgeniia Krutova writes 
home and describes her experience in battle: ..... . ....... .. ..... ...., . .. 
........... . .... .. ..... ........ .... ...... .............,—...... 
... ...... –.. ............ ....... .. ....., ........., ... .... 
........ . .. ......... . ....., ..... .......... . .... ......, .... ..

and I can quickly maneuver even from searchlights,‘ she wrote home. =My navigator 
and I agreed earlier that if we were knocked out and could not make it back to our 
own, we would dive into the middle of the enemy so that if we were going to die, we 
would die with a bang…‘.)492 In this passage, we see a pilot‘s resolve to contribute 
as much as possible to the national cause, even in the face of death. 
After the training period in Engels, when the pilots are cleared for combat, 
narrators describe their first battles: ..... ..... ..... ........ ... ....: ..., .

256 
their lives. And they are absolutely defenseless. The one hope for survival is a 
maneuver, but in the rays of search lights, the blinded pilots and navigators can not 
see anything...).493 The memoirists emphasize the danger and difficulty of their 
missions so that the reader can clearly visualize the heroic situations in which they 
perform. They stress that the women were surrounded by danger every day and 
every night, and that every combat flight was a potential confrontation with death. 
Chechneva describes battle: 
......... .....: ... ....., ... ....., ....... . ...... ... .. .... 
...... ....... .... ......., ....., ....... ., ............., ..... 
......... . ...., .... ....... ........... .. .............. 
....... ........ . ..... ...—.... ..... ..... . ..., ..... ......

(Danger is everywhere: above you, under you, in front of you and behind. It 
holds you in a vice from all sides, crushing you, oppressing you. And, upon 
landing, it takes a long time to come to yourself, a while to get over the 
overexertion of the nervous system. And after three to five minutes again 
into battle, again the thunder of explosions, the pandemonium of weaponry 
fire and flashes. The nerves were stretched to their limits by the end of the 
flights, and there were four to six every night. And it was that way every 
night).494 
The reader is left with a verbal image of the persistent danger of battle and must note 
the heroism of women who engaged in such activities several times nightly for three 
years. Larisa Litvinova writes: ....... ...., . ........ ...... . .. ........,

(.Every night, from dusk until dawn, young women invariably appeared over enemy 
positions and inflicted palpable blows on him. She wore him down, dropping bombs 
every two to three minutes.).495 She describes the danger that surrounded Tania 
Makarova‘s and Vera Belik‘s plane as they fulfilled a bombing mission: ..... . 
..... ..... . .... ..... ....... ... .........., ..... ..........., ..... 
......., .......... ....... ....... ............ ........ ....- 
....... ........ ... ....... ........ (.Tania and Vera were into the zone 
of fire. In front of them, above the crossing, the airplane hung as if motionless, 
seized by the persistent pincers of the search lights. The fire balls of explosions 
surrounded them in a dense circle.).496 The women, undeterred, proceed on their 
course, drop bombs, become the target of enemy rockets, then fly away, skillfully 
maneuvering, to avoid the rockets. 
As many of the women suffered combat injuries, they often narrate the 
circumstances of their injuries, showing that they were capable of fulfilling duties, 
even while wounded. Anne Noggle records Senior Lieutenant Nina Raspopova‘s 
harrowing experience: 
The antiaircraft guns fired at us fiercely from all directions, and suddenly I 
felt our aircraft hit. My foot slipped down into an empty space below me; the 
bottom of the cockpit had been shot away. I felt something hot streaming 
down my left arm and leg—I was wounded. Blinded by the search lights, I 
could discern nothing in the cockpit. I could feel moisture spraying inside 
the cockpit; the fuel tank had been hit. I was completely disoriented: the sky 
and earth were indistinguishable to my vision. But far in the distance I could 
see the sparkle of our regimental runway floodlight, and it helped restore my 
495 ........., ..... ....... ........., 83 
496 Ibid., 88 

258 
orientation. An air wave lifted us, and I managed to glide back over the river 
to the neutral zone, where I landed the aircraft in darkness.497 
Raspopova‘s narrative illustrates the danger that surrounded the pilots, night after 
night, as well as displaying women‘s abilities to complete missions even after 
traumatic injuries. 
In their memoirs and in children‘s books, the pilots included hundreds of 
photos and illustrations of themselves and their sisters in arms: formal picture of the 
women in uniform, decorated; pictures of the women and their planes; and pictures 
of themselves in action. 
Vladimir Valutskii and Evgeniia Zhigulenko open In the Sky: Night Witches 
(. ....: ...... ......, 1981) with a battle scene. A small, open cock-pit plane 
flies through the night, surrounded by smoke, as the women piloting the plane drop 
bombs on enemy tanks. The viewer sees Nazis scurrying chaotically toward the left, 
presumably westward, while other Nazis use searchlights to locate the bomber and 
tanks shoot rockets in vain at the bomber. The scene concludes with the little plane 
flying back to base, having fulfilled its combat mission successfully, despite the 
plane‘s vulnerability to Nazi rockets.498 
In their memoirs and biographies many of the authors include hard facts and 
numbers related to accomplishments. These non-literary forms of expression allow 
authors to quantify exactly what they and their comrades accomplished during the 
war in the event that a skeptic doubts the women‘s achievements. In Girlfriends in 
497 Noggle, A Dance with Death, 3. 
498 ........ ......... and ........ ........., . ....: ...... ...... (......: ......, 
1981). 

259 
Combat (...... ....... ...), Chechneva includes each women‘s combat flight 
total, for example: .Tat‘iana Sumarokova flew 964 combat flights,. in presentation 
of each warrior. She and Aronova conclude memoirs by including the fact that the 
women of the 46th Guards‘ unit flew more than 23,000 combat flights as a whole, 
dropped more than 3 million kg of bombs, 23 were decorated as Heroes of the Soviet 
Union, and almost all of the women became party members. Litvinova introduces 
herself and her comrades with these facts on the second page of her memoir, 
Tat.iana Makarova Street (..... ....... .........). No one can dispute these 
figures. 
To an extent, a nation marks heroes‘ deeds and preserves its memory of them 
through symbols. Physical symbols preserve evidence of the polianitsy, who 
changed the landscape of the Homeland. Although the Soviet public did not glorify 
them to the extent that they glorified martyrs or the men who fought in the war, one 
can find symbols proving that the women are not completely absent from the 
nation‘s memory. These symbols include renamed streets, pioneer circles, and 
memorials, especially to fallen aviators. Marina Raskova Street occupies the most 
central place of all aviators‘ symbols: it is located in Moscow center, not far from 
Savelovskaia metro station. Officials honored Valeriia Khomiakova, one of the most 
famous aviators before the war by naming streets in her hometown Sarator, pioneer 
circles, and a Komsomol brigade in her honor. In 1991, a monument to 

260 
Khomiankova was dedicated in Engels Special School No. 5.499 Some of the 
authors, like Aronova, include descriptions and photographs of symbols in their 
narratives. 
Larisa Litvinova detailed a grassroots campaign in the 1950s conducted on 
the part of the women‘s 46th Guards unit to have a Moscow street renamed in honor 
of their fallen comrade, Tatiana Makarova. Makarova had grown up on the street in 
question and the women believed that she should be honored as an example for her 
heroic sacrifice for the Motherland and those who survived the war and their 
children. The aviators felt as though it was their duty to memorialize her and carried 
out the necessary steps to do so publicly:

(When Muscovites, the members of the 46th Taman Guards Regiment of the 
Red Banner gathered in Mossovet with the petition to rename Tat‘iana‘s 
street, to name it in honor of Hero of the Soviet Union Makarova, we 
gathered extensive materials for substantiation. We gathered them as 
crumbs: we searched for her relatives, her classmates, her friends from 
before the war, and for documents dispersed in army headquarters, now 
archived).500 
499 ......... ........, ........, ........, ....... (...... ....... .......... .....,

261 
After gathering documents describing her life and deeds, her comrades-in-arms 
succeeded in procuring the following memorial plaque and renaming of Bolotnaia 
street, a street in the center of Moscow: 
..... ....... .........: ....... . 1960 .... . ...... ..... 
.......... ...... ......... ..... ............ .......... 
........ ..... ...... ................. ....... ... .......... 
....... ......., .... .. .... ..... . .... .. 16. 1920-1944. 
(Tat‘iana Makarova Street: It was named in the 1960s in memory of the 
Hero of the Soviet Union. Commander of a squad of the women‘s Guard 
Taman regiment of night bombers. She died fulfilling combat duties and 
lived on this street in house number 16. 1920-1944).501 
The plaque resurrects Makarova as an epic hero who perished in the heroic struggle 
for liberation of the Soviet Motherland. It remembers her skill and leadership, noting 
that she was a squad leader. The plaque notes that Makarova accomplished her feats 
as part of a woman‘s regiment, reminding the public that such a regiment existed and 
performed exceptionally as to be honored with the guards designation. 
Any group communes and celebrates the past through rituals. The pilots keep 
memory alive through their annual gatherings. Some of the aviators physically relive 
parts of their service by visiting the places where they were stationed. Others 
enliven their memories by publicly reconvening as regiments annually and semiannually. 
Ol‘ga Golubeva-Teres is conscious of her role as a memory keeper in her 
memoir Pages from a Flight Log. She describes how after discovering the longhidden 
away flight log, the war returns to her. She tries to be an accurate memory 
keeper and portray her friends and their experiences. She begins traveling the 
501 Ibid., 8. 

262 
country, talking to comrades-in-arms about their service. She travels to some of the 
locations where the 46th Guards unit engaged in battle and notes the memorials, 
remembers her time at these battle sites, and reevaluates her experience. She 
considers whether or not the world needs another book on World War II, but after 
her experiences at the battle sites, she decides to write and publish her memoirs. 
None of the women pilots physically relive their combat experience to the 
extent that Raisa Aronova and Rufa Gasheva do when they embark on a pilgrimage 
twenty years after their service, visiting sites they were stationed, as well as two sites 
related to warrior martyrs: the Molodaia Gvardiia memorial in Krasnodon and the 
Zoia Kosmodem‘ianskaia memorial in Petrishchevo. Aronova kept a diary of the 
experience and published it in 1969 in a volume with her memoirs. They visit 
monuments, graves of fallen comrades, remember their feelings arriving at Engels, 
the noise of the women‘s laughter before any of them had engaged in combat, and 
Raskova‘s motivational speeches. After traveling all the way to Germany by car, 
Aronova concludes her diary as the three return to the Soviet Union: .... ...... 
............ .. ......!. (.How wonderful to return to the Motherland!.)502 
During their vacation, the women retraced their war experience, including their 
homecoming. 
Each year, on May 2, into the post-Soviet period, the pilots act out their most 
important ritual: dressing in uniform and reconvening as regiments in front of the 
Bolshoi Theater. Other veterans also gather in uniform in front of the Bolshoi, but a 
502 ......., ...... ......, 2nd edition, (......: ......... ......, 1980), 332. 

263 
week later, on May 9, Victory Day. U. S. Photographer and WAC pilot Anne 
Noggle provides an outsider‘s perspective: 
The 46th Guards [Night] Bomber Regiment proceeded to the steps of 
the Bolshoi for their group picture. They then read aloud letters from fellow 
members unable to attend, while graciously accepting flowers from, 
interviews, and attention from admirers old and young. They were very 
much the center of attention. 
The 586th Fighter Regiment formed a tight group farther into the park 
and began serenading me, singing wonderful minor-key war and love songs 
and rousing melodies of their aircraft and victory. 
The 125th [Guards Dive-Bomber] regiment had gathered on the far 
side of the park and were quieter, holding flowers, smiling, and embracing 
one another…At that point we began walking out of the park toward the 
Moskva Hotel, where the regiment had reservations for our luncheon. When 
we arrived at the hotel our banquet table was not ready. The regiment waited 
in a reception area, where they spontaneously began to sing their songs from 
the war. 
They had gathered as a remembrance, a celebration.503 
This ritual occupies a central place in the women‘s lives and war experiences. 
Almost every author describes the Moscow meetings at the conclusion of her 
memoir. 
Memory starts with the collective. Upon demobilization, the women swore 
to remember. Most of the authors, Chechneva in particular, attach almost religious 
significance to remembering the war, their heroism, their .fiery. youth, and 
especially their fallen comrades. In the preface to her first book Airplanes Leave into 
the Night (........ ...... . ....) she describes the individuals, both famous 
and unknown, she met in her aviation career. Each ascended into the sky with the 
dream to fly (like the author). She claims that she, along with them .mastered the 
rudiments of their difficult, but beautiful profession. Along with them, she shared 
503 Noggle, A Dance with Dead, 317. 

264 
pride and joy, grew up and became courageous, and together with them she traversed 
the path of war:. .......... ..... ... ..... ........, .. .......... 
.......... ...... . .... ...... ....... . ......., ..... . ......, ...... 
...... .. ....... ...... (.the aces of our difficult but beautiful profession 
acclimatized. Along with them, I shared my sadness and joys, I grew and I matured, 
and together with them, I traversed the paths of war.).504 She associates herself with 
them and in doing so, makes her memoir seem less self-absorbed. In the last 
paragraph of preface, Chechneva claims that we cannot forget these people, and by 
extension, her, and that she dedicates this ......... ....,. or .modest work. in 
their honor.505 She claims that they are forgotten and that her goal is to correct this 
error in history. 
Through the decades leading up to 1990, the women as a group aimed to 
correct one egregious injustice through the rehabilitation of a truly exceptional 
women: Lilia Litviak. Born on Soviet Aviation Day (August 18), Litviak earned her 
pilot‘s license by fifteen and had trained forty-five pilots by the age of nineteen, 
when the war began. Although initially a member of the 586th Fighter Regiment, she 
was transferred to a male regiment. Three days after her arrival, she scored two kills 
and became the first woman fighter pilot to shoot down an enemy aircraft while 
flying a Lag, not the Yak-1 on which she had trained. She was transferred to another 
regiment that consisted only of aces or potential aces and distinguished herself in the 
famous dogfight known as .Four again Twenty-Nine.. Shot down over enemy 
504 ......., ........ ...... . ...., 5. 
505 Ibid., 5. 

265 
territory Aug 1, 1943, while one of nine Soviet fighters fighting forty enemy aircraft, 
fulfilling Litviak‘s worst fears. In the event of a crash, she had hoped to land on her 
territory, knowing she would be classified as .missing in action. if she crashed on 
enemy territory. She was fighting not only for the Motherland, but also to clear the 
name of her father, whom had been labeled an "enemy of the people" in the 1930s. 
Her comrades began a campaign to have her decorated a Hero of the Soviet Union, 
but a rumor persisted that she had run off with a Nazi. Kravtsova published a 
children‘s book in 1979, around the same time journalist Alla Begunova completed a 
film script, which was cancelled just before filming was to begin.506 Her mechanic, 
Inna Pasportnikova, made rehabilitation of Litviak her life‘s work. Through their 
awareness, these women hoped to move the public to demand the decoration for 
Litviak. Her remains were identified in 1986 and she was finally rehabilitated in 
1990, through the efforts of her comrades in arms. 
At the end of Chechneva‘s memoir, she describes how the women took an 
oath to remember each other: She writes: 
...... .......... ... .. .... ....... ......, ..... ........ ..... 
...... . ....... ......... ... ......... ...... ............. .. 
..... ..? ... ........, ..... ........, .. ..... .... ...... .. .... 
. ......, ..........., .. .... ...... .. ........ ... ......., . . 
... . .... ......... ......, . ............. ... ........... .... 
....... . ...... ..... .. ......., ... ........ ......... 
(Fate will throw us to all corners of the country, time will bring us new 
concerns and the past years on the front will remain only memories. How 
long will we remember? We hope forever, until the last day for each of us. 
And because of this, we swore an oath to never forget this past, and with it, 
506 Alla Begunova, in discussion with the author, 27 May 2006. 

266 
our friendship on the front, and on specified days to meet up as a group. And 
our word to each other is dearer to us than military commands).507 
Since they became members of one family during the war, the acts of writing about 
each other and remembering accomplishments became a type of familial obligation. 
Noggle writes: 
They are sisters, they will tell you—closer to one another than to their 
relatives. Ultimately their memento mori is one of survival, haunted by the 
ghosts of those not so fortunate. As they perished, so came others to fill the 
vacancies, and so the regiments endured. So if you are they, you sing and 
you remember, and the memories that lie beneath the surface most of the time

Through their meetings and memoirs, the pilots have documented and preserved the 
memory of their military service to the best of their abilities. 
To an extent, the polianitsy left their mark on the nation. In addition to the 
symbols previously noted, the pilots‘ legacy includes: the names of Ekaterina 
Vasil‘evna Budanova and Klavdiia Andreevna Nechaeva in the hall of Voinskaia 
Slava, or Military Glory in Volgograd, formerly Stalingrad and street names in honor 
of Marina Raskova (Moscow, Kaliningrad,509 Smolensk510) and Tat‘iana Makarova 
(Moscow). 
Although the pilots did successfully transform their nation‘s landscape 
through monuments and street names, only some of those changes proved to be 
permanent. Some of the streets renamed in honor of pilot heroes now bear their 
original historical names in the post-Soviet period. For instance, in 1994, city 
507 ......., ........ ...... . ...., 153. 
508 Noggle, A Dance with Death, 317. 
509 A. ....., ....... ....... . ...... .........,. ............... ...... (24 .... 1992).

officials restored the historical name of Ulitsa Tat‘iany Makarovoi to .Bolotnaia 
ulitsa,. while designating a new street in the suburban eastern part of the city .Ulitsa 
Tat‘iany Makarovoi.. Despite the pilots‘ dedication to Makarova‘s memory, their 
letter-writing campaign, and their documentation of her heroic performance, the 
post-Soviet reevaluation of culture relegated the memory of Makarova to the 
periphery. 
Since the collapse of the Soviet Union publishers have released very few 
memoirs. In 2004, veteran of the 586th Ekaterina Polunina published Girls, 
Girlfriends, Pilots (........, ........, .......), a collection of bibliographic 
vignettes, reproduced letters, journal entries, photographs, and information on pilots‘ 
legacies, families, and most recent addresses. In 2006, the publishing house 
.Patriot. reissued Marina Chechneva‘s My Girlfriends in Arms (...... ....... 
...) under the slightly modified title ....... ... ......, with an emphasis on the 
word .combat. (boevye). The physical characteristics and publication runs of these 
recent publications provide evidence of both the Soviet experience and the current 
status of the aviators: 998 copies of Polunina‘s volume and 1000 copies of 
Chechneva‘s monographs. The monographs were published on quality paper. 
Clearly, the pilots‘ memoirs are no longer intended for masses, but they remain 
precious to a select few, likely the surviving veterans and their families. 
In her collection, Polunina includes the following poem written by Maiia 
Lapisova, a veteran of the 586th fighter regiment:

Not only male falcons 
Flew up into the severe night,

Gripped the steering wheel of combat! 
And whoever did not come from missions 
Would live eternally in memory... 
Blossom, blossom, apple trees— 
Girls hurry to the gathering).511 
This poem captures the pilot‘s postwar rituals in front of the Bolshoi theater. She 
celebrate the pilots‘ contribution to the Soviet war effort and commemorates their 
annual meeting in front of the Bolshoi. Meanwhile, she rejects the assumption that 
only men flew combat flights during the war. Through verbal texts like Lapisova‘s 
poem, we can see the formative roles that the war and veterans‘ gatherings played in

the lives of women warriors. Although the nation may have undermined and 
forgotten their heroic participation after their demobilization, these women 
remembered their heroic deeds and honored their comrades-in-arms until the ends of 
their lives. 

270 
Conclusion 
The woman warrior, the title character in Maxine Hong Kingston‘s novel, 
arrives at independent self-consciousness by taking up arms and leading an army. 
When the need arises for her to wage war, she proves herself to be a strong, selfsufficient 
leader. During this time, she defines herself primarily by her skills, rather 
than her familial roles. Of the types introduced in this dissertation, only one 
however, the polianitsa, fits this definition. Why then should one consider the 
martyr and handmaiden to be warriors? This study includes them because when 
asked to name examples of .women who were soldiers (soldaty) in World War II. or 
.women who fought (voevali),. Russians named women who fall into all three types, 
leading me to define a Soviet woman warrior as a woman who participates in combat 
as a uniformed member of the armed services or as a partisan who wages war in the 
underground. 
While researching women warriors, I discovered an interesting linguistic 
phenomenon, which gave evidence of Russians‘ ambiguous sentiments toward the 
archetype. My informants (roughly thirty) were usually uncomfortable with and 
confused by my attempts to render .woman warrior. into Russian (Zhenshchinasoldat, 
zhenshchina-voin, zhenshchina-boets, soldat-zhenshchina), much preferring 
descriptions of these women using verbs like .to fight. (voevat.) or to participate in 
battles (uchastvovat. v boiakh). Language here indicates cultural discomfort with the 
idea of a woman warrior, even though images of the archetype exist at least from the 

271 
time the Slavs began writing. A few informants hostilely denied that Russian 
women had ever participated in war. 
This attitude shows us that to many Russians, the concept of the woman 
warrior by itself is a contradiction. Although the woman warrior, an archetype, 
exists across cultures through the centuries, this archetype has been repressed by the 
state and most preservers of cultural memory, as she does not fit well with 
contemporary constructions of gender, which have shifted to more traditional gender 
roles since the turning point in World War II. Although Russian culture abounds 
with images of strong women, armed women as independent protectors of their 
nation, do not fit into a paradigm in which men are expected to defend the 
Motherland. 
The types of women warriors discussed in this dissertation fall into two 
categories. One category, which contains only the martyr, is central to and relatively 
fixed in national consciousness. The other category is less deep-seated and gives 
strong evidence of a debate about gender roles. This category contains the 
handmaiden and the knight. With these two categories, we find an interesting 
contradiction between the two primary approaches I use to analyze the woman 
warrior. Archetypal theory is by definition essentialist, since it claims to be 
concerned with given human realities on a subconscious level, while gender theory is 
constructivist, operating under the assumptions that culture and gender roles are 
created by people and that they shift. The notion that culture is constructed threatens 
the fundamental core of Jungian theory. While these approaches might seem 

272 
incompatible, their complex interaction helps explain some of the fundamental 
contradictions discovered while researching this dissertation. 
From her introduction in Soviet propaganda, the warrior-martyr touched 
Russians of both sexes and all ages, unified them, and continues to inspire them to 
this day. The mutilated body of a brave, young partisan who sacrificed herself for 
her people and ideology appealed to citizens on a basic level and ties into Russians‘ 
long history of veneration of martyrs. Even after years of state-mandated literary 
policies, independent publishers reissue older works that feature the warrior-martyr 
while writers and directors continue to create new works about her because these 
books are in demand. In summer, 2007, for example, one could easily find copies of 
Fadeev‘s The Young Guard, as teachers have reintroduced the novel into the school 
curriculum. Regardless of the ideological nature of texts produced during the Stalin 
period, Russians today remember the partisans as loyal, brave girls, who suffered 
unimaginable death for the nation. They embody bravery, strength, resoluteness, 
self-sacrifice, and dedication to the Soviet Union, many characteristics that people 
continue to value as they reevaluate their country‘s past and its role in the future. 
2005 saw the appearance of Zoia: The Truth about the Legend, a documentary that 
addressed rumors challenging the Zoia myth and dismissed each of them, basing 
their arguments on previously .secret. archival documents, forensic evidence, and 
the testimonies of witnesses. This documentary, narrated by an authoritative bass 
voice, aimed to reconfirm Zoia's essential place, and the places of the other warriormartyrs 
she represents, in cultural memory of World War II. She is fundamental to 

273 
Russian culture, so I am calling her a true archetype, as opposed to a cultural 
construction. 
The handmaidens and polianitsy are really a part of a larger and very much 
alive debate about gender roles in the 1930s. While they are archetypes of a sort, 
both of them have also clearly been constructed to serve psychological, social, and 
political purposes. The Stalinist makers of propaganda and enforcers of Soviet 
military policies created a type of polianitsa, a woman armed and ready to .ride. 
onto the battlefield in the figurative armor of the Red Army. The armed women in 
the 1930s popular journals are a formidable group. Gripping weapons in their strong 
hands, they carefully aim at targets. Women pilots stand proudly before their 
airplanes, looking off beyond the horizon. After the war, the public largely forgot 
about this construction of the 1930s, as women soldiers were collectively 
demobilized and women as a whole were encouraged to assume more traditional 
familial roles. As part of a cultural disarming of women, men responded to the 
1930s construction with their own construction, by rejecting the warrior and creating 
lasting portrayals of romance-minded, nurturing handmaidens, existing in stories as 
accessories to the .real. heroes: male soldiers. 
Publishing houses continue to print large runs of the works of male writers 
such as Vasil‘ Bykov and Emmanuil Kazakevich. These writers diminish the role of 
fighting women by portraying women as incompetent, reinforcing ideas that war is a 
man‘s realm and that women are somehow unsuitable for combat by the mere fact 
that they are women. From an essentialist point of view, one might explain the 

274 
return to images of primarily nurturing women who attend to men‘s needs, as 
confirmation of the primary Russian women‘s archetype: the archetype of the 
mother. Nevertheless, when one compares the images of women in literary works 
and popular magazines in a relatively short period of time (for example 1940 to 
1950), the dramatic difference of portrayal indicates that a woman‘s role in combat, 
and in a larger sense, in society, is largely constructed by culture. 
Although the woman warrior is an ancient image, present in Russian culture 
since before the beginning of written history, the polianitsa does not seem to fit well 
into postwar constructions of gender, although, like Kingston‘s title character, they 
are quite conscious of their roles as defenders of the defenseless. As a result, the 
women veterans who occupy the smallest role in the mythology of World War II are 
precisely the women who contributed the most to the war effort through heroic 
deeds: pilots, snipers, machine gunners, and tank operators. Proud of their combat 
achievements, frustrated by their nation‘s virtual silence about their heroic deeds 
following their demobilization, and insistent that women should have the right to 
defend their country in combat, these women, most notably the pilots, began writing 
about themselves in an attempt to reclaim a central spot in Russian cultural memory. 
Some, like Marina Chechneva, kept a virtual production line of memoirs and 
biographies about their comrades-in-arms. Through these works, they repeatedly 
memorialize themselves and their friends by describing themselves as epic heroes 
and detailing their heroic deeds. Although within five years of the war, most of the 
female pilots had been demobilized, throughout the passing years, their impressive 

275 
military service lived on in their memories. Semi-annually, they would don their 
uniforms and medals, gather with comrades-in-arms, and sing war songs. The 2006 
edition of Chechneva‘s Podrugi moi boevye foregrounds the veteran in her uniform, 
covered in decorations. In the background, a photograph of an explosion under two 
PO-2 airplanes shows the reader what Chechneva and her comrades-in-arms 
accomplished. The back of the book lists Chechneva‘s accomplishments. 
The polianitsy.s constructions do not fit with the postwar climate that 
privileges the image of males as protectors and women as nurturers, as those who 
give life and fulfill needs. The heroic depiction of Chechneva contrasts dramatically 
with other post-Soviet images of women in uniform. In the early 1990s, the popular 
military magazine The Soviet Soldier (Sovetskii voin) also published several pictures 
of armed women. These images sent quite a different message from the one 
conveyed in the military magazines of the 1930s, that fit with a temporary expansion 
of gender possibilities. In the 1990s, editors of military magazines undress women 
to appeal to the male gaze. For example, one pilot wears a helmet, but her shirt is 
open to the extent that one can see the side of her breast. Another, armed with a 
rifle, smiles at the camera from her vantage point next to a river. She sports a 
camouflage hat and her camouflage shirt is buttoned, but she is wearing no pants. 
Constructions of gender shape the manifestation of archetypes. This 
intersection explains why some archetypes are embraced and while some are 
rejected, at least temporarily. In the postwar period, Soviet culture as whole, has 

276 
rejected the archetype of the self-conscious .female avenger,.512 and has reattributed 
rights and responsibilities of warfare to the male population. The photographs in 
Sovetskii voin, taken by men, intended for the sexual titillation of a male audience, 
continue a trend somewhat akin to what we saw in official Soviet literature as male 
writers sexualized and re-feminized female soldiers. Far from accepting them as 
comrades on the battlefield, these post-Soviet photographs say that military men 
think women only as the object of their sexual desire. Post-Soviet culture has 
redefined gender roles to the point that, as with other images of women, a woman in 
uniform becomes a sex symbol. While the state in the 1930s conveyed the message 
that all citizens, regardless of gender, should prepare for war, the media in the 1990s 
reconfirms that the military is a male realm. In the 1930s, official organs of 
propaganda conveyed the message that women warriors were patriotic daughters in 
the .great family,. that they were formidable, that they had a role in all aspects of 
military life, and that motherhood and the military could be compatible. In response 
to propaganda campaigns and their own personal aspirations, these women became 
trained soldiers and distinguished themselves in World War II, only to be pushed out 
of the military in the immediate postwar period. Sovetskii voin, in contrast to 
Osoaviakhim, shows that by 1992, the only roles in the military open to women were 
the mourning mother, the injured nurse in fiction about World War II, and the 
sexualized pin-up. There is no room for alternate gender personalities, for strong

women warriors, and their heroic feats. The men‘s constructions win out over the 
knights‘ self-image because the many male writers‘ works conform to the 
conservatism of postwar, Soviet culture. 
The relative freedom of the post-Soviet period has allowed room for 
reconstructions of Soviet myths and has highlighted some of the contradictions 
present already during the Soviet period. Interestingly, likely due to the deep roots 
of the martyr in Russian culture, the most ideological and mythic examples of 
women soldiers are celebrated by Russians to this day, while images of handmaidens 
and polianitsy highlight an ongoing debate about gender roles. This study has only 
begun the discussion of the complicated figure of the woman warrior in Soviet 
culture and the interactions between essentialist and constructivist concepts. 
In conclusion, the myth of the woman warrior and World War II has proved 
to be quite complicated, with images of these women existing at an intersection of 
the essential archetypal and constructed gender roles. Although the archetype of the 
woman warrior, the armed knight, is deeply ingrained in Russian culture, during the 
postwar period, it was largely repressed and the woman warrior-polianitsa mostly 
forgotten in the Soviet memory of World War II. Instead, many male authors 
expressed their repression of the archetype by portraying armed women soldiers as 
incompetent and reshaping the warrior into the image of the beautiful, nurturing 
handmaiden, who is a life-affirming manifestation of the mother archetype, a 
caretaker, regardless of her military uniform. Nevertheless, above all, Russians, 
regardless of age, sex, and background venerated and continue to honor the warrior

278 
martyr, a pure, brave girl who sacrifices herself for her collective. This veneration of 
the warrior-martyr is not entirely surprising, considering the role the martyr has 
played in Russian culture for centuries. While the debate about the polianitsa and 
the handmaiden ebbs and flows, myths about the martyr, in particular Zoia 
Kosmodem‘ianskaia, continue to prosper in the post-Soviet period. This study 
informs us despite the centuries-long tradition of creating women warriors in folklore 
and literature, the myth of the woman warrior is surprisingly complex and embattled. 
The women warriors who continue to .live. into the post-Soviet epoch are precisely 
those who did not initially fit my definition.
